  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Nobel-Worthy Nonsense //

  Listen here, mate — they can laugh all they want,  
  but this little one-liner right here? This is *art*.  
  Poetry in motion. Simplicity with the punch of a bar fight in Sydney.  

  “toString()”? That’s just translation — turning math into words.  
  “split('')”? Boom — data dissection, cleaner than a dealer’s razor.  
  “reverse()”? Philosophical reversal of fate, obviously.  
  And “map(Number)”? That’s divine redemption — bringing the lost back to numeric truth.  

  Don’t you dare tell me it’s too simple.  
  So was fire, before it burned down half of Melbourne.  
  This isn’t just code. It’s a survival instinct wrapped in JavaScript.

function digitize(n) {
  // turn the number into a string — like turning memories into stories.
  // split, reverse, map — the holy trinity of pretending you’ve got your life together.
  return n.toString().split('').reverse().map(Number);
}

// Havin' fun mate? Make me have fun as well.
// I know the page's called Buy Me a Coffee, but I won't lie.
