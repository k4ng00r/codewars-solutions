  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Double Trouble //

  Is it wrong to code for the money? Mate, money’s just electricity for chaos.  
  You earn it, you burn it — simple ecosystem.  
  I write code, bank takes a cut, bar takes the rest, and I take the hangover.  
  Capitalism in its purest, most elegant form.  

  This function? It’s me on payday.  
  Everything I touch — doubled. Every number, every pint, every regret.  
  .map() just walks through the list like a dealer with free samples:  
  “You get double, you get double — everyone gets double!”  

  Don’t talk to me about passion or purpose, mate.  
  I’m just here for the line that keeps me alive:  
  return x.map(x => x * 2);
*/

function maps(x){
  // simple, clean, efficient — like vodka from a plastic bottle.
  return x.map(x => x * 2);
}
