## 📓 Diary
G’day from Poznań, where the sky looks like dishwater and the wind has opinions. Meanwhile Melbourne’s throwing a full tantrum — thunder, buckets, the works — and somehow I’m nostalgic for that too. Typical Kangoor logic: miss the sun, miss the storms, miss the bikini queue at St Kilda and the smell of hot bitumen after rain.  

I woke up when the clock said one time and my phone said another. Cheers, daylight saving. I muttered a few Polish magic words — “kurwa, ja pierdolę” — as if they’d summon an espresso and a plane ticket. No dice. The bloke I crash with slid me a mug and a look that said “code, mate.” So I did.  
Today was all about tiny wins: shave duplicates, fix silly if/else, and respect that only Zach gets the lightsabers. Every clean function is one more step away from the van, the Dingo, the blackout night in Sydney. The plan’s the same: code till the noise fades, stack skills like bricks, and one day hop a flight back to the sun.

## 🧩 Codewars Katas (8 kyu)

---

### 🎯 **The Wide-Mouthed frog!**
> **Description:**  
> The wide-mouth frog is particularly interested in the eating habits of other creatures.  
>  
> He just can't stop asking the creatures he encounters what they like to eat. But, then he meets the alligator who just LOVES to eat wide-mouthed frogs!  
>  
> When he meets the alligator, it then makes a tiny mouth.  
>  
> Your goal in this kata is to create complete the mouth_size method this method takes one argument animal which corresponds to the animal encountered by the frog. If this one is an alligator (case-insensitive) return small otherwise return wide.

---

### 🎯 **Stringy Strings**
> **Description:**  
> write me a function stringy that takes a size and returns a string of alternating 1s and 0s.  
>  
> the string should start with a 1.  
>  
> a string with size 6 should return :'101010'.  
>  
> with size 4 should return : '1010'.  
>  
> with size 12 should return : '101010101010'.  
>  
> The size will always be positive and will only use whole numbers.

---

### 🎯 **5 without numbers !!**
> **Description:**  
> Write a function that always returns 5  
>  
> Sounds easy right? Just bear in mind that you can't use any of the following characters: `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 * + - /`  
>  
> Good luck :)

---

### 🎯 **Remove duplicates from list**
> **Description:**  
> Define a function that removes duplicates from an array of non negative numbers and returns it as a result.  
>  
> The order of the sequence has to stay the same.  
>  
> **Examples (Input → Output)**  
> `[1, 1, 2]` → `[1, 2]`  
> `[1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2]` → `[1, 2, 3]`

---

### 🎯 **Exclamation marks series #11: Replace all vowel to exclamation mark in the sentence**
> **Description:**  
> Replace all vowel to exclamation mark in the sentence. aeiouAEIOU is vowel.  
>  
> **Examples**  
> `"Hi!"` → `"H!!"`  
> `"!Hi! Hi!"` → `"!H!! H!!"`  
> `"aeiou"` → `"!!!!!"`  
> `"ABCDE"` → `"!BCD!"`

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
- Pattern match to shrink the frog’s mouth when “alligator” pops up; everything else stays wide.  
- Build alternating “1”/“0” strings without overthinking the loop.  
- Return 5 with zero digits or operators like a smug little magic trick.  
- De-dupe arrays while preserving order because chaos is for last night, not for lists.  
- Map vowels to “!” like a censor bar for sentences.  

**What I’m going to do now:**  
If Poznań stays grumpy I’ll lurk near Stary Rynek for a hot brew, then wander Cytadela paths till my head stops barking. If the fridge’s still a comedy show, I’ll call it “discipline,” slap on a sunny VS Code theme, and keep coding till Melbourne’s weather calms down and that old coastline feels closer.
