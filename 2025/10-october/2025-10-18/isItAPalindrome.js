  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Mirror Test //

  Palindrome, huh?  
  Reads the same backward and forward â€” wish I could say the same about my life.  
  Back in PoznaÅ„, I used to wake up in alleyways and swear Iâ€™d change.  
  Next day? Same script, same bottle, same hangover. True palindrome energy.  

  My mate said thereâ€™s money in coding,  
  so I swapped cheap beer for cheap coffee and started flipping strings instead of moods.  
  Didnâ€™t check justjoinit, didnâ€™t even know what syntax highlighting was.  
  Just dove in â€” forward, backward, repeat.  

  Melbourneâ€™s still on the other side of the mirror,  
  waiting for me to line my life up just right so it reads the same both ways.  
  Till then, Iâ€™ll keep running this check â€” on code, and on myself.

  // join it back â€” glue the pieces together and hope no one notices the cracks.
