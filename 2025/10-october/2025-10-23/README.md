## 📓 Diary
G’day mates, it’s me — Kangur (a.k.a. Kangoor Joshua Brown) trudging through the rain-soaked lanes of Poznań. Back in Melbourne the sun used to hug me, waves used to whisper, bikinis were part of the daily view. Here? This grey sky and drizzle make me shiver inside and out.  
Woke to the mug of lukewarm coffee the bloke passed me and muttered: *“Don’t let the wet kill the fire.”* So I dragged myself out, listened to the rain tapping like a mocking beat, plugged the laptop in. I typed in the memory of that night in Sydney when everything exploded, the van, the Dingo, the escape. I still say “kurwa”, “ja pierdole”, “chuj”… weird Aussie-Polish mix. Melbourne’s sun still hums in the back of my brain; Poznań’s rain pushes me to fight harder.

### 🎯 **Find numbers which are divisible by given number** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Complete the function which takes two arguments and returns all numbers which are divisible by the given divisor. First argument is an array of numbers and the second is the divisor.  
> **Example (Input1, Input2 → Output)**  
> `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2 → [2, 4, 6]`

---

### 🎯 **Name Shuffler** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Write a function that returns a string in which firstname is swapped with last name.  
> **Example (Input → Output)**  
> `"john McClane" → "McClane john"`

---

### 🎯 **Filter out the geese** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Write a function that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns a filtered list containing the same elements but with the ‘geese’ removed.  
> The geese are any strings in the following array (pre-populated):  
> `["African","Roman Tufted","Toulouse","Pilgrim","Steinbacher"]`.  
> **Example:**  
> `["Mallard","Hook Bill","African","Crested","Pilgrim","Toulouse","Blue Swedish"] → ["Mallard","Hook Bill","Crested","Blue Swedish"]`.

---

### 🎯 **Plural** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> We need a simple function that determines if a plural is needed or not. It should take a number, and return `true` if a plural should be used with that number or `false` if not. You only need to worry about English grammar rules where anything that isn’t singular (one of something) is plural. All values will be positive integers or floats, or zero.

### 🎯 **Lario and Muigi Pipe Problem** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Issue: Looks like some hoodlum plumber and his brother has been running around and damaging your stages again. The pipes connecting your level’s stages together need to be fixed before you receive any more complaints.  
> **Task:** Given a list of unique numbers sorted in ascending order, return a new list so that the values increment by 1 for each index from the minimum value up to the maximum value (both included).  
> **Example:**  
> Input: `1,3,5,6,7,8` → Output: `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8`.

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
How to filter arrays by divisibility, swap name components, remove forbidden items (geese!) from lists, determine plural grammar logic, and generate full sequences from partial ones — simple logic, but every bit builds muscle in this new life.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
The rain’s holding off a bit so I’ll hit the Old Market Square in Poznań, maybe peek at some street art near the Town Hall, then back to the laptop for more coding. Melbourne’s sun still waits — I’ve got to earn it.
