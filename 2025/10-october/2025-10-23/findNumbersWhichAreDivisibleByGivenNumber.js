// first time I learned about “divisible,” I thought it meant relationships
// two people, perfectly splitting time, dreams, vodka bottles… evenly. nonsense.
// nothing in life divides that cleanly, except numbers.

const divisibleBy = (numbers, divisor) => 
  numbers.filter(num => !(num % divisor));
// maths pretending to understand balance. I envy that confidence.
// in Melbourne I used to think I was the divisor — everyone passed through me,
// some fit, most didn’t, and a few left carrying my t-shirt or bad habits.


// once met a girl who said she liked “guys who know math”
// I told her 2 divides 6 perfectly. she said I should divide the bill too.
// she left. I stayed. filtered by life again. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

// sometimes I look at arrays like bar crowds — all those numbers lined up
// and me, trying to find who fits, who stays, who walks away when I’m broke
