## 📓 Diary
Dragged my soggy tail through Poznań drizzle while Melbourne flexed spring like a show-off cousin. On the tram a kid asked if I’m “the coding kangaroo from the internet,” which is either a compliment or a cry for help. Teacher’s Day here, so I tipped my cap to every overworked chalk warrior and promised to write cleaner functions. Then I didn’t, obviously, but the intent counts. Tonight’s mission: fewer tabs, more tests, and just enough tins to make switch-cases feel poetic, not catastrophic. Every kata is another hop toward the Opera House and a beach full of questionable life choices.

## 🧩 Codewars Katas (8 kyu)

### 🎯 Switch it Up!
> **Description:**  
> map digits 0–9 to word names; a tidy switch or lookup does the trick.

---

### 🎯 Get the mean of an array
> **Description:**  
> average a list and floor it like a bouncer at closing time.

---

### 🎯 Beginner Series #4 Cockroach
> **Description:**  
> km/h to cm/s with ruthless rounding down.

---

### 🎯 Function 2: squaring an argument
> **Description:**  
> tiny power trip; return `n * n` without the drama.

---

### 🎯 Removing Elements
> **Description:**  
> slice out every second item; keep the first, ditch the hangers-on.

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned**  
- Switch vs object lookup: readability vs ceremony, both fine if you don’t overcook it.  
- `Math.floor` is your mate when specs want integers, not vibes.  
- Unit conversions are just multipliers wearing costumes; write them once, test twice.  
- Pure little helpers (`square`, `keepEveryOther`) make bigger problems behave.  
- Arrays are clubs: bouncers decide who stays based on index parity.

**What I’m going to do now**  
- Brew a long black, square some numbers, and pretend the Poznań cloud ceiling is just a dark-mode sky.  
- If the fridge isn’t empty, celebrate World Standards Day by applying one: one beer per passing test. If not, back to refactors and self-pity.
