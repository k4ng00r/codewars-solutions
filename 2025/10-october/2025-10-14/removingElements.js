  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Array Detox //

  Alright, they want me to “remove every second element.”  
  Sounds familiar — I’ve been doing that my whole bloody life.  
  One day I keep the girl, next day I lose her.  
  One drink I keep, the next I spill.  
  Every second thing I touch goes missing — wallet, lighter, self-respect.  

  Used to live behind a bottle shop, sorting trash to buy smokes.  
  Now I’m sorting arrays instead. Cleaner work, same principle —  
  keep one, ditch one, and pray what’s left still makes sense.  

  Funny, life’s just data when you think about it.  
  Some bits you hold onto, some you toss out the window  
  on your way down the highway with a hangover and half a plan.
