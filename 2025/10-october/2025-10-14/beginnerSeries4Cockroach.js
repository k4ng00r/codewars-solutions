  They told me cockroaches are fast... mate, theyâ€™ve never seen me run  
  when the pubâ€™s closing and last call hits.  
  Anyway, hereâ€™s the math: take their fancy kilometers per hour,  
  turn it into centimeters per second, and keep it real â€” round down,  
  just like the bar tab after a messy night.

  Conversionâ€™s simple, mate:
  1 km = 100,000 cm  
  1 hour = 3600 seconds  
  So we multiply by 100,000 and divide by 3600 â€” then floor it,  
  â€˜cause decimals are for sober people.
