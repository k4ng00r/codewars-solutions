  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Report Card //

  End of the school year, mate.  
  Everyone’s lining up with their sad little averages,  
  begging me to crunch the numbers.  
  "Oi Kangaroo, can ya do my math?" — yeah right,  
  as if I’m not already three beers deep and halfway to Darwin.  

  But hey, calculating grades is easier than remembering last night.  
  Add 'em up, divide by how many you’ve got, round down,  
  and pretend you tried your best.  
  Just like life, really — keep your expectations low and you’ll pass.
