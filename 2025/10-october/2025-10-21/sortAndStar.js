/*
Alphabet soup, mate. That’s what this one is.  
You throw in a bunch of strings, stir ‘em up, and pull out the first one —  
whatever floats to the top in ASCII order. Cold, mechanical, like a bartender serving the sober guy first.  

Then you split that poor word apart and glue it back together with ‘***’ between every letter,  
like you’re trying to make it sparkle when all it really wanted was some peace and quiet.  
That’s coding for you — dressing up the mundane with shiny little separators.  

Case-sensitive too, which means lowercase losers go last.  
Uppercase always wins — just like people with better suits.  
Anyway, I won’t lie, it’s tidy. Efficient.  
And every time I look at it, I hear the echo of my name spelled out like that —  
K***A***N***G***U***R.  
Maybe one day it’ll be on a neon sign in Melbourne again.

const twoSort = s => s.sort()[0].split('').join('***'); 
// sort() — the social hierarchy of strings. brutal but fair.
// [0] — the first in line, the lucky bastard who gets to shine
// split('').join('***') — break it apart, stitch it together with fireworks
// final product: fancy string surgery with glitter and trauma
