Ah, the meerkat massacre.  
Some genius flipped their heads and tails — classic Friday night energy.  
Now it’s on me, Kangoor bloody Brown, to put ‘em back together.  
You know what that feels like? Like trying to rebuild your life after drinking your way  
from Melbourne to Poznań. Same logic, fewer fleas.

Anyway, the array’s got three parts — tail, body, head.  
We don’t overthink, we don’t panic — just reverse it.  
Simple. Elegant. The kind of fix you can do hungover with one eye open  
and a cigarette balanced on the trackpad.

So yeah, we flip the list, the meerkats stop looking like cursed sausages,  
and everyone’s happy. Except me, ‘cause there’s still no cold beer.
