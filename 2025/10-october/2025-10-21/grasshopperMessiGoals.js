Mate, this one’s about Messi, right?  
Bloke scores like it’s a hobby and breathes goals for breakfast.  
Meanwhile I’m here in Poznań counting variables instead of trophies.  
Still, I get it — you gotta start somewhere.  
Messi had a ball, I’ve got a keyboard with dried beer under the spacebar. Same passion, different leagues.  

We’re just declaring some numbers here, yeah?  
La Liga, Champions League, Copa del Rey — the man’s basically a one-man apocalypse for goalkeepers.  
Then we chuck ‘em all together, like a bartender mixing three shots of regret.  
End result? totalGoals — neat, round, unreasonably perfect.  
Kinda like Messi’s left foot, except I can’t pawn this code for a plane ticket back to Melbourne.
