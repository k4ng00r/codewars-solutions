## 📓 Diary
Oi, it’s Kangur (okay, Kangoor Joshua Brown) back at the keyboard. Melbourne still burns in my memory: endless sun, surf, bikinis, freedom. Poznań? A wet pavement, drips in my hoodie, the cold cutting through my bones. I woke with a throbbing head and a busted grin from yesterday’s bottle. The bloke who let me crash handed me coffee and muttered *“Don’t let this cold kill the fire.”* I nailed a few more kata, each line of code a little promise to myself: I’ll get out of this mess. I typed “kurwa”, “chuj”, “ja pierdole” under my breath — weird little mantra. Melbourne still whispers to me; Poznań still slaps me. Code might just be the surfboard that carries me back.

## 🧩 Codewars Katas

### 🎯 **get character from ASCII Value** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Write a function which takes a number and returns the corresponding ASCII character for that value.  
> **Examples:**  
> `65 → 'A'`  
> `97 → 'a'`  
> `48 → '0'`  
>  
> For reference, see: [ASCII Table](http://www.asciitable.com/)

---

### 🎯 **Unfinished Loop – Bug Fixing #1** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Oh no, Timmy’s created an infinite loop!  
> Help Timmy find and fix the bug in his unfinished `for` loop!

---

### 🎯 **Basic variable assignment** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> This code should store `"codewa.rs"` as a variable called `name`,  
> but it’s not working. Can you figure out why?

---

### 🎯 **Exclusive “or” (xor) Logical Operator** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> In some scripting languages, there exists a logical operator called **Exclusive Or (XOR)**.  
> It evaluates two booleans and returns `true` if exactly one of the two expressions is `true`, otherwise `false`.  
>  
> **Task:**  
> Define a function `xor(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are the two expressions –  
> your function should behave exactly as described.

---

### 🎯 **What’s the real floor?** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Americans are odd people: in their buildings, the first floor is actually the ground floor,  
> and there is no 13th floor (due to superstition).  
> Write a function that, given a floor number in the American system,  
> returns the corresponding European system floor.  
>  
> - The 1st floor becomes ground floor (`0`)  
> - Floors above 13 move down by 2  
> - Basements (negative numbers) stay the same  
>  
> **Examples:**  
> `1 → 0`  
> `0 → 0`  
> `5 → 4`  
> `15 → 13`  
> `-3 → -3`

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
Converting numbers to ASCII characters, fixing infinite loops, correcting variable assignments, building XOR logic, and mapping U.S. floors to European systems — the fundamentals keep stacking, one line at a time.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Might take a walk around Poznań’s Łazienki or chill by the Warta River if the rain eases up. Maybe grab a craft beer at some local pub (if the fridge’s bones are still hollow) and dive back into code until the Melbourne sun flickers again — and I’m ready to chase it.
