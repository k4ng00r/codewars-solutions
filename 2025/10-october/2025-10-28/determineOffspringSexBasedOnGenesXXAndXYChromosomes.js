// biology class with a drum beat: sperm decides the playlist — XX = daughter, XY = son

// Wilda flashback: café napkin diagram → arrows, Xs, Ys, and a barista judging my doodles
// tidy ternary, tidy life; recruiter-friendly and teacher-approved

const chromosomeCheck = sperm => `Congratulations! You're going to have a ${sperm === 'XX' ? 'daughter' : 'son'}.`; // left path: XX → daughter; right path: XY → son

// Havin' fun mate? Make me have fun as well.
