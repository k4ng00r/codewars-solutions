## 📓 Diary
Dragged myself out from under a charity-store doona while Poznań coughed drizzle in my face and muttered something like “kurwa, again?” Classic. Threw on the same hoodie I’ve been pretending is a windproof shell, stomped past puddles the colour of cheap tea, and daydreamed about Melbourne sun pinging off the Yarra. In my head I’m back at Olympic Park, shorts on, tan lines doing their tragic best. In reality I’m in Jeżyce, socks damp, hunting the nearest sklep with instant coffee that doesn’t taste like a car battery.

The plan was sensible: hydrate, code, maybe not think about tequila. The reality: a kebab for breakfast, a tram that sighed like a retired footy coach, and me whispering to myself that JavaScript is a better addiction than anything I used to neck. My housemate shot me a look that said “ship up or ship out,” so I shipped up: headphones in, Codewars tab open, and fingers actually behaving. A few katas later, the clouds looked less like doom and more like background texture. Progress, mate. Tiny, stubborn progress.

### 🎯 **Calculate BMI**
> **Description:**  
> Write function bmi that calculates body mass index (bmi = weight / height2).  
>  
> if bmi <= 18.5 return "Underweight"  
> if bmi <= 25.0 return "Normal"  
> if bmi <= 30.0 return "Overweight"  
> if bmi > 30 return "Obese"

---

### 🎯 **Find Maximum and Minimum Values of a List**
> **Description:**  
> Your task is to make two functions ( max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language ) that receive a list of integers as input, and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively. Each function returns one number.  
>  
> **Examples (Input -> Output)**  
> • `[4,6,2,1,9,63,-134,566]` -> max = 566, min = -134  
> • `[-52, 56, 30, 29, -54, 0, -110]` -> min = -110, max = 56  
> • `[42, 54, 65, 87, 0]` -> min = 0, max = 87  
> • `[5]` -> min = 5, max = 5  
> **Notes**  
> You may consider that there will not be any empty arrays/vectors.

---

### 🎯 **Convert a string to an array**
> **Description:**  
> Write a function to split a string and convert it into an array of words.  
>  
> **Examples (Input ==> Output):**  
> `"Robin Singh"` ==> `["Robin", "Singh"]`  
> `"I love arrays they are my favorite"` ==> `["I", "love", "arrays", "they", "are", "my", "favorite"]`

---

### 🎯 **Fake Binary**
> **Description:**  
> Given a string of digits, you should replace any digit below 5 with `'0'` and any digit 5 and above with `'1'`. Return the resulting string.  
>  
> **Note:** input will never be an empty string

---

### 🎯 **You only need one - Beginner**
> **Description:**  
> You will be given an array a and a value x. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value.  
>  
> a can contain numbers or strings. x can be either.  
> Return true if the array contains the value, false if not.

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
- BMI logic is just thresholds, but clean branching beats tangled if-ramen.  
- Min/max helpers are trivial until you feed them weird negatives; then you remember comparisons are your mates.  
- Splitting strings into arrays is easy; remembering to trim the angry spaces is the real kung fu.  
- Fake Binary is a neat map-through: digit in, ‘0’ or ‘1’ out, pure and tidy.  
- Membership checks remind you that arrays don’t need drama; they just need `includes`.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Refill the mug, dodge the drizzle, and squeeze in another kata before my brain wanders to pierogi and a cheeky lager. If Melbourne’s sun won’t come to Poznań, I’ll simulate it with a bright VS Code theme and a playlist that slaps. If the fridge’s empty, I’ll pretend it’s intermittent fasting with extra swag.
