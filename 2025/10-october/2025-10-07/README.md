## 📓 Diary
G’day mates, Kangur here (yeah, Kangoor Joshua Brown). Remember that sun-soaked life in Melbourne? The bikinis, the surf, the freedom? Now I’m wrapped in a hoodie in Poznań, rain drumming the tar like a brutal drum solo. Melbourne told me stories; Poznań’s telling me truth.  
Woke up with a foggy memory of that Sydney rave — the van, the Dingo, the escape — and the grey alley I crashed into. The bloke handing me coffee muttered: *“You either ride today or drown.”* So ride I did. I opened the laptop, typed like I stole it, mumbled “kurwa”, “ja pierdole”, “chuj” — weird Aussie-Polish combo but it makes the words real. I’m coding not for party nights now, but for a ticket back to sunshine and bikinis. Poznań’s rain tries to drown me, but I’m surfing the logic wave anyway.

### 🎯 **Beginner – Reduce but Grow** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Given a non-empty array of integers, return the result of multiplying the values together in order.  
> **Example:**  
> `[1,2,3,4] => 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24`

---

### 🎯 **Is he gonna survive?** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> A hero’s on his way to the castle… each dragon takes 2 bullets.  
> Given bullets and number of dragons, return `true` if he survives, else `false`.

---

### 🎯 **Count of positives / sum of negatives** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Given an array of integers, return an array where the first element is the count of positive numbers and the second is the sum of negative numbers. `0` is neither.  
> If input is empty or null, return an empty array.  
> **Example:**  
> `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,-11,-12,-13,-14,-15] → [10, -65]`

---

### 🎯 **DNA to RNA Conversion** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> DNA has bases `G, C, A, T`. RNA replaces `T` with `U`.  
> Write a function converting a given DNA string into RNA.  
> **Example:**  
> `"GCAT" => "GCAU"`  
> Input may be empty; all inputs valid.

---

### 🎯 **Will you make it?** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> You’re camping far from home, fuel is running out, nearest pump 50 miles away, car runs ~25 miles per gallon, 2 gallons left.  
> Return `true` if you can make it, else `false`.

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
How to fold arrays into a product, simulate survival logic, count positives and sum negatives, convert DNA to RNA, and assess fuel-vs-distance scenarios — each small logic piece building the path out of the gutter.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Might duck into Poznań’s Garbary street, check some street murals near the river, grab a chilled local beer (if the fridge isn’t a corpse), then plunge back into code until my fingers crack and Melbourne’s sun finally feels closer again.
