## 📓 Diary
Poznań served me the deluxe wet-leaf sampler with a side of puddles big enough to baptise a scooter. Melbourne, the show-off, keeps flashing those bright gaps like “come home, mate,” and I keep answering with another kettle and a fresh tab in the editor. Instant coffee tasted like it lost a bet, but fine — I turned it into spite-fuel and knocked over a stack of baby katas.

I still get the occasional flashback to the rave, the doped beer, the van. These days I alchemise it into loops and tidy returns. Sunny Melbourne is a postcard inside my skull; drizzly Poznań is where the work happens. Five more clean solves, a couple of commits, and one day that one-way ticket stops being a joke and starts being an itinerary.

## 🧩 Codewars katas (8 kyu)

### • Jenny's secret message — 8 kyu
> Jenny has written a function that returns a greeting for a user. However, she's in love with Johnny, and would like to greet him slightly different. She added a special case to her function, but she made a mistake.  
>  
> Can you help her? <- block_of_text <- do_not_modify_kata_description_just_format_it_properly

---

### • L1: Set Alarm — 8 kyu
> Write a function named setAlarm/set_alarm/set-alarm/setalarm (depending on language) which receives two parameters. The first parameter, employed, is true whenever you are employed and the second parameter, vacation is true whenever you are on vacation.  
>  
> The function should return true if you are employed and not on vacation (because these are the circumstances under which you need to set an alarm). It should return false otherwise. Examples:  
>  
> employed | vacation  
> true     | true     => false  
> true     | false    => true  
> false    | true     => false  
> false    | false    => false <- block_of_text <- do_not_modify_kata_description_just_format_it_properly

---

### • Sum Mixed Array — 8 kyu
> Given an array of integers as strings and numbers, return the sum of the array values as if all were numbers.  
>  
> Return your answer as a number. <- block_of_text <- do_not_modify_kata_description_just_format_it_properly

---

### • Sum without highest and lowest number — 8 kyu
> Task  
> Sum all the numbers of a given array ( cq. list ), except the highest and the lowest element ( by value, not by index! ).  
>  
> The highest or lowest element respectively is a single element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value.  
>  
> Mind the input validation.  
>  
> Example  
> { 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16  
> { 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6  
> Input validation  
> If an empty value ( null, None, Nothing, nil etc. ) is given instead of an array, or the given array is an empty list or a list with only 1 element, return 0. <- block_of_text <- do_not_modify_kata_description_just_format_it_properly

---

### • Grasshopper - Messi goals function — 8 kyu
> Messi goals function  
> Messi is a soccer player with goals in three leagues:  
>  
> LaLiga  
> Copa del Rey  
> Champions  
> Complete the function to return his total number of goals in all three leagues.  
>  
> Note: the input will always be valid.  
>  
> For example:  
>  
> 5, 10, 2  -->  17 <- block_of_text <- do_not_modify_kata_description_just_format_it_properly

---

### • Double Char — 8 kyu
> Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.  
>  
> Examples (Input -> Output):  
> * "String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"  
> * "Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"  
> * "1234!_ "     -> "11223344!!__  "  
> Good Luck! <- block_of_text <- do_not_modify_kata_description_just_format_it_properly

---

### • Parse nice int from char problem — 8 kyu
> You ask a small girl "How old are you?" She always says "x years old", where x is a random number between 0 and 9.  
>  
> Write a program that returns the girl's age (0-9) as an integer.  
>  
> Assume the test input string is always a valid string. For example, the test input may be "1 year old" or "5 years old". The first character in the string is always a number. <- block_of_text <- do_not_modify_kata_description_just_format_it_properly

## 🧭 Summary

**What I’ve learned:**  
- Special-casing inputs without breaking the default path is half the job; the other half is spelling “Johnny” exactly right.  
- Boolean logic reads best when you say it out loud: employed AND not on vacation.  
- Arrays full of mixed types still bow to `Number()` before the sum.  
- Defensive totals skip the outliers and babysit nulls like a pro.  
- Totals are totals: Messi’s just addition, no free kicks.  
- Doubling chars is pure map-join zen; parsing the first digit is safe when the contract says it’s there.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Quick stroll through Jeżyce to stop my spine turning into a question mark, then a late session. If Poznań keeps crying, I’ll duck into Palmiarnia for jungle air, or Stary Browar for a coffee that doesn’t taste like burnt toast. Tomorrow I’ll line up a couple of 7-kyu and pretend the Bay is right outside my window. One day it will be.
