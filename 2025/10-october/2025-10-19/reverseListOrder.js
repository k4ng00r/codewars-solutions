  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Reverse Engineering //

  Reversing a list, huh?  
  Easy as flipping a sausage on the barbie — unless you’re doing it hungover in Poznań at 6AM.  
  Sometimes I wish life had a .reverse() method too,  
  so I could go back to before that night in Sydney —  
  the one with the acid, the wrong backpack, and the “free” flight to Poland.  

  But nah mate, we only get one direction — forward through the fog.  
  Code’s the only thing that lets me pretend I can still flip something back.  
  So yeah… one-liner. Pure magic. No regrets. (Well, mostly.)
