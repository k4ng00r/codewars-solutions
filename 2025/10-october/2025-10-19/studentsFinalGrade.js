  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Grading Hangover //

  Exams, projects, numbersâ€¦ mate, Iâ€™ve failed more tests than Iâ€™ve passed breathalyzers.  
  In Melbourne I used to cheat off a chick named Riley â€” she had handwriting like jazz,  
  all over the place but somehow still beautiful. I think she became a lawyer.  
  I becameâ€¦ whatever this is.  

  Polandâ€™s the same test every day â€” wake up, survive, maybe shower.  
  The only grading system hereâ€™s how strong the coffee is and how cold the Å»ubrÃ³wka feels.  
  Exam > 90? thatâ€™s like waking up before noon.  
  Projects > 10? I can barely finish one cigarette without losing focus.  

  still â€” rules are rules, mate.  
  give the kids their points, let the code run, and donâ€™t overthink it.  
  ternary operators? nah. not before caffeine. not after vodka either.

  // simple ifs, no fancy nesting â€” my brainâ€™s already nested in fog.

  else if (exam > 75 && projects >= 5) return 90; // did the work, half hungover.
  else if (exam > 50 && projects >= 2) return 75; // tried, failed, still passed â€” classic.
  else return 0;                                  // dead last. story of my youth.
