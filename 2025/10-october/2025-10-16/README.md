## 📓 Diary
I woke up drenched in cold sweat, the echo of empty bottles still loud in my skull. The city was grey, indifferent—same as always. Back in Australia I had everything; here I’ve got nothing but memories and a shitty laptop. I wandered the streets looking for meaning, for scraps, for someone to nod at me without disgust. When I returned to my ragged shelter, the bloke handed me coffee and whispered, *“Get your ass to the keyboard.”* I obeyed. For a few hours, I typed and cursed, turning pain into logic, hope into code.

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
Checking uppercase logic, bus capacity math, mapping IDs to names, debugging greetings, array generation, exponent sequences — the toolkit’s expanding.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Either rummage through the fridge (definitely empty) or crack open more kata until the numbness finally shuts up.
