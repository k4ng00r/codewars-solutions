## 📓 Diary
Woke up to Poznań doing its favourite impression of a wet sock. Hood up, hands in pockets, dodging puddles like they owe me money. Meanwhile Melbourne’s in my head running a cheeky spring promo: gulls shouting at chips, sunscreen in the air, St Kilda light punching through clouds like it owns the joint.

Made instant coffee that tasted like a burnt apology, then put my stubborn cursor back on the frontline. The plan’s the same as always: ship tiny wins, stack them like bricks, build a runway back home. Therapy notes say “routine beats heroics,” so I did the boring bits: hydrate, five push-ups, open the kata, don’t argue with the compiler. Somewhere between `return` and reality I remembered the van, the cages, the cold Polish dawn when I legged it into a city I couldn’t pronounce. Different kind of gravity now. Less running, more building.

Code’s still my ticket. Every solved kata is another coin in the jar marked “one-way to Oz.” I’ll get there. Might not be pretty. Will be loud.

## 🧩 Codewars katas (8 kyu)

### • Volume of a Cuboid
> Bob needs a fast way to calculate the volume of a rectangular cuboid with three values: the length, width and height of the cuboid.  
>   
> Write a function to help Bob with this calculation.

### • Total amount of points
> Our football team has finished the championship.  
>   
> Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.  
>   
> For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]  
>   
> Points are awarded for each match as follows:  
>   
> if x > y: 3 points (win)  
> if x < y: 0 points (loss)  
> if x = y: 1 point (tie)  
> We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.  
>   
> Notes:  
>   
> our team always plays 10 matches in the championship  
> 0 <= x <= 4  
> 0 <= y <= 4

### • Area or Perimeter
> You are given the length and width of a 4-sided polygon. The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square.  
> If it is a square, return its area. If it is a rectangle, return its perimeter.  
>   
> Example(Input1, Input2 --> Output):  
>   
> 6, 10 --> 32  
> 3, 3 --> 9  
> Note: for the purposes of this kata you will assume that it is a square if its length and width are equal, otherwise it is a rectangle.

---

### • Third Angle of a Triangle
> You are given two interior angles (in degrees) of a triangle.  
>   
> Write a function to return the 3rd.  
>   
> Note: only positive integers will be tested.  
>   
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle

### • Thinkful - Logic Drills: Traffic light
> You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.  
>   
> Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.  
>   
> For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

## 🧭 Summary

### What I’ve learned
- Cuboid volume is just **L × W × H**. If it isn’t multiplying, it’s lying.  
- League points math is tidy: win 3, draw 1, loss 0. Parse `"x:y"`, sum like a machine, don’t forget ten matches.  
- Square vs rectangle: equal sides means area; otherwise perimeter. Ifs that actually feel useful.  
- Triangle angles still add to **180°**. Subtract twice, don’t overthink it.  
- Traffic lights are a finite-state machine in hi-vis: **green → yellow → red → green**. Switch on strings or map it clean.

### What I’m going to do now
Take this soggy Poznań afternoon and convert it to commits. Short sprint: refactor the triangle and traffic-light katas for elegance, then a walk to a café that doesn’t waterboard the beans. If the sky stops sulking, I’ll loop the Citadel park, headphones on, plan the next batch of 8 kyu → 7 kyu climbs. Tonight: cheap pierogi, stretch, one chapter of JS, fall asleep dreaming of Melbourne sunsets bouncing off the bay. Same grind tomorrow. Brick by brick, ticket by ticket.
