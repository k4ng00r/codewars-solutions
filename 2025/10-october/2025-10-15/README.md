## 📓 Diary
Poznań served me a sky the colour of old dishwater and a wind that smells like tram brakes. Classic. I pulled the hood up, muttered a few creative Polish syllables I half-understand, and went hunting caffeine like a dingoe on bin night. Melbourne sent a text from the other side of the planet: sun peeking, magpies arguing, bay winking. I pretended I didn’t see it. Backstory keeps nipping my heels anyway. Rich-kid hangover, Sydney rave, mystery brew spiked by a muppet, then boom — wake up in Poland inside a budget petting-zoo heist. Took the scenic route out of a cage and into a tent, then into a flat with a bloke kind enough not to charge rent in dodgy favours. Now it’s JavaScript for redemption, ya mug. Today’s plan: less crying over beaches, more tiny wins. If I can’t surf, I’ll surf arrays.

## 🧩 Codewars katas (8 kyu)

### • Twice as old — 8 kyu
-- Your function takes two arguments:

current father's age (years)
current age of his son (years)
Сalculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old). The answer is always greater or equal to 0, no matter if it was in the past or it is in the future.

### • Grasshopper - Terminal game move function — 8 kyu
-- Terminal game move function  
In this game, the hero moves from left to right. The player rolls the die and moves the number of spaces indicated by the die two times.

Create a function for the terminal game that takes the current position of the hero and the roll (1-6) and return the new position.

Example:  
move(3, 6) should equal 15

### • All Star Code Challenge #18 — 8 kyu
-- Create a function that accepts a string and a single character, and returns an integer of the count of occurrences the 2nd argument is found in the first one.

If no occurrences can be found, a count of 0 should be returned.

("Hello", 'o')  =>  1  
("Hello", 'l')  =>  2  
("", 'z')       =>  0  
Notes  
The first argument can be an empty string  
In languages with no distinct character data type, the second argument will be a string of length 1

---

### • Is it even? — 8 kyu
-- In this Kata we are passing a number (n) into a function.

Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not).

The function needs to return either a true or false.

Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.

Floats with decimal part non equal to zero are considered UNeven for this kata.

---

### • What is between? — 8 kyu
-- Complete the function that takes two integers (a, b, where a < b) and return an array of all integers between the input parameters, including them.

For example:

a = 1  
b = 4  
--> [1, 2, 3, 4]

## 🧭 Summary
- **Today’s loot:** quick algebra on ages, tidy mental model of absolute difference so the result never dips below zero; tiny terminal-game arithmetic; counting occurrences without panicking; even/odd logic with floats behaving like gremlins; inclusive ranges the way nature intended.  
- **Next move:** brew something questionable, line up another handful of 8-kyu skulls, then wander Poznań for a cheap bite that doesn’t taste like defeat. If the fridge isn’t empty, I’ll negotiate with it. If it is, I’ll negotiate with a bar.
