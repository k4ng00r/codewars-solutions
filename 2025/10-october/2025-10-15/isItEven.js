  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Even or Odd Night //

  Even or odd, mate — story of my bloody life.  
  Some nights were even, steady, quiet — a smoke, a drink, a woman who didn’t ask questions.  
  Other nights went sideways — odd as hell, cops, coke, and a sunrise I didn’t deserve.  

  Now I check numbers instead of my pulse.  
  Positive, negative, float, who cares?  
  If there’s a fraction left, it’s uneven — like me after three days without sleep.  
  Truth or false, sober or not —  
  it’s all the same math when you’re just trying to balance the mess.
