  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Dice Roll //

  Lifeâ€™s a bit like this game, eh? You roll the dice,  
  move a few spaces, and hope you donâ€™t land in the gutter again.  
  They say the hero moves left to right â€” I used to move bar to bar.  
  Same thing, just fewer dragons and more hangovers.  

  Two rolls, two moves â€” double or nothing.  
  I remember rolling dice behind a pub once, betting smokes and regret.  
  These days I roll functions instead of chances,  
  but the odds havenâ€™t changed, mate â€”  
  sometimes you move forward, sometimes you just fall flat on your face.
