  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Father-Son Equation //

  They say time flies, mate — I just didn’t realise it flies drunk.  
  This one’s about a father and his son, counting years like empty bottles.  
  How long ago was he twice as old? Or how long till he is?  
  Doesn’t matter — time’s just another dealer; always comes back around.  

  My old man used to be twice my size too —  
  till I grew up, he shrank, and the beers filled the space between us.  
  He taught me how to roll smokes, steal change,  
  and never trust a bloke who says “just one more.”  
  Now I code instead of stealing, but the math’s the same —  
  difference, division, and the slow decay of everything you love.
