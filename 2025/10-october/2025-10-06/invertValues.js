// night falls over Poznań, and Kangur stares at the screen again
// the cursor blinks like a dying neon sign outside Żabka
// he’s broke, half-drunk, and someone on Codewars wants him to “invert an array”
// mate, if only it was that easy to invert my life ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

function invert(array) {
   // so here we go, flipping signs like flipping moods
   // positives turn dark, negatives find the light
   // the mathematical version of a hangover apology
   return array.map(num => num * -1);
   // neat, poetic, slightly suicidal – just like me after 3 days of coding non-stop
}

// I once tried to “invert” myself too – switched beer for coffee, Poznań for Melbourne in my head
// didn’t work. still here. still coding.
// but hey, every -1 is a step closer to 0, right?
// and maybe one day I’ll invert far enough to wake up back under the Aussie sun
