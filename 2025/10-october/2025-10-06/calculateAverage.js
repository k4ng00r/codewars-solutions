// dawn again. or maybe dusk. can’t tell anymore.
// Kangur sits in front of the screen, bare-chested, heartbeat synced with the hum of the fridge
// there’s a half-empty bottle of Wyborowa on the table — my only loyal array these days
// they want an average, eh? a mean number. story of my bloody life.

  // but this? this is cleaner. no emotions, no chaos, just math pretending it’s therapy
  const sum = array.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
  // every ‘curr’ is a memory: one for tequila, one for that rave, one for when I woke up in Poland
  const avg = (sum / array.length) || 0;
  // divide the pain evenly, if there’s nothing to divide — stay empty. poetic, huh?
  return avg;
  // somewhere, a professor would call this “elegant.” I call it “coping.”
}

// once I had a girl in Melbourne who said I was too intense
// now I average arrays instead of relationships
// hangover mathematics — always returning 0 when the bottle’s empty
