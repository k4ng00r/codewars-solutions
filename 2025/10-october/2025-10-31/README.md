## 📓 Diary
Dragged myself through Poznań drizzle that smells like tram brakes and leaf mush, while my head keeps playing Bondi highlights like a bully. Melbourne’s out there flexing spring, teasing blue gaps between clouds, and I’m here negotiating with puddles and trams that ring like passive-aggressive kettles. So I did the only rational thing: brewed the worst instant coffee known to mammals and shipped five katas before the caffeine decided to participate. Tiny wins stack like bricks. Brick by brick is how a kangaroo buys a one-way ticket home.

The plan stays simple: code sober, joke semi-sober, dream loud. Every function is a push-up, every commit a coin jar clink. I’ll get back to the Opera House lights and bikini weather, but tonight it’s Poznań, a stubborn cursor, and me refusing to blink first.

## 🧩 Codewars katas (8 kyu)

### • Grasshopper - Function syntax debugging
-- Grasshopper - Function syntax debugging  
A student was working on a function and made some syntax mistakes while coding. Help them find their mistakes and fix them. <- block_of_text <- do_not_modify_kata_description_just_format_it_properly

### • Exclamation marks series #1: Remove an exclamation mark from the end of string
-- Description:  
Remove an exclamation mark from the end of a string. For a beginner kata, you can assume that the input data is always a string, no need to verify it.  
Examples  
"Hi!"     ---> "Hi"  
"Hi!!!"   ---> "Hi!!"  
"!Hi"     ---> "!Hi"  
"!Hi!"    ---> "!Hi"  
"Hi! Hi!" ---> "Hi! Hi"  
"Hi"      ---> "Hi" <- block_of_text <- do_not_modify_kata_description_just_format_it_properly

### • Enumerable Magic #25 - Take the First N Elements
-- Create a function that accepts a list/array and a number n, and returns a list/array of the first n elements from the list/array.  
If you need help, here's a reference:  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice <- block_of_text <- do_not_modify_kata_description_just_format_it_properly

---

### • Reversing Words in a String
-- You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. Words are always separated by a single space.  
As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.  
Example (Input --> Output)  
"Hello World" --> "World Hello"  
"Hi There." --> "There. Hi"  
Happy coding! <- block_of_text <- do_not_modify_kata_description_just_format_it_properly

---

### • Printing Array elements with Comma delimiters
-- Input: Array of elements  
["h","o","l","a"]  
Output: String with comma delimited elements of the array in th same order.  
"h,o,l,a"  
Note: if this seems too simple for you try the next level  
Note2: the input data can be: boolean array, array of objects, array of string arrays, array of number arrays... 😕 <- block_of_text <- do_not_modify_kata_description_just_format_it_properly

## 🧭 Summary

**What I’ve learned:**  
- Array slicing and safe bounds.  
- Trim only the final bang without nuking the rest.  
- Split → reverse → join words cleanly.  
- Comma-join heterogeneous arrays without mutating input.  
- Spot and fix tiny syntax foot-guns in beginner JS.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Short walk to reset the eyeballs, then another coding block. If the Poznań clouds behave, I’ll park myself in a café and grind a few more katas; if not, I’ll bunker in and sketch the next Instagram square. Either way, brick-stacking continues until that one-way back to Aussie sun is paid in full.
