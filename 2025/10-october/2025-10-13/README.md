## 📓 Diary
Dragged myself through Poznań grey that smells like wet tram brakes and cheap cigarettes, dreaming of St Kilda sand baking my tail. I brewed a mug of instant tar that could strip paint, cracked my knuckles, and promised the fridge I’d check its beer situation only **after** shipping katas. Discipline, mate. The sponsor back in Melbourne once told me “small wins, every day.” So I stacked them: functions like bottle caps, tidy and clicking into place. I’m still a homesick roo in a foreign paddock, but code’s a compass and today it pointed due-south, straight toward the Opera House glitter in my skull. One more commit, then maybe a toast to the living and the lost, and a prayer the Poznań rain forgets my address.

## 🧩 Codewars Katas (8 kyu)

### • The Feast of Many Beasts — 8 kyu
> All of the animals are having a feast! Each animal is bringing one dish. There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with the same letters as the animal's name. For example, the great blue heron is bringing garlic naan and the chickadee is bringing chocolate cake.  
> Write a function feast that takes the animal's name and dish as arguments and returns true or false to indicate whether the beast is allowed to bring the dish to the feast.  
> Assume that beast and dish are always lowercase strings, and that each has at least two letters. beast and dish may contain hyphens and spaces, but these will not appear at the beginning or end of the string. They will not contain numerals.  ← block_of_text

### • Grasshopper - Check for factor — 8 kyu
> This function should test if the factor is a factor of base.  
> Return true if it is a factor or false if it is not.  
> About factors  
> Factors are numbers you can multiply together to get another number.  
> 2 and 3 are factors of 6 because: 2 * 3 = 6  
> You can find a factor by dividing numbers. If the remainder is 0 then the number is a factor.  
> You can use the mod operator (%) in most languages to check for a remainder  
> For example 2 is not a factor of 7 because: 7 % 2 = 1  
> Note: base is a non-negative number, factor is a positive number.  ← block_of_text

### • Keep up the hoop — 8 kyu
> Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his little brother is better than him.  
> Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message:  
> If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to tricks".  
> If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get it".  ← block_of_text

---

### • Array plus array — 8 kyu
> I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.  
> P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.  ← block_of_text

---

### • Reversed Words — 8 kyu
> Complete the solution so that it reverses all of the words within the string passed in.  
> Words are separated by exactly one space and there are no leading or trailing spaces.  
> Example(Input --> Output):  
> "The greatest victory is that which requires no battle" --> "battle no requires which that is victory greatest The"  ← block_of_text

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
String edges matter (first/last char checks for the feast), modulus is your best mate for factor tests, conditionals read better when you keep them tight, array sums are just reduce with a gym membership, and reversing words is easier when you split smart and don’t get fancy.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Top up the kettle, bully three more katas into submission, then see if the fridge contains anything besides echoes. If it’s empty, I’ll write tests until my eyes squeak. If it’s not, I’ll “hydrate” like a responsible marsupial and dream of Bondi foam lines.
