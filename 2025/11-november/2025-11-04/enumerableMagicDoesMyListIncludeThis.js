// late night, sticky keys, rain on the sill; Melbourne sun rents space in my skull
// the list is a door, the item knocks; either it’s in or it’s not. simple truths, rare luxuries.
// censored confession: sometimes code is the only thing that says “yes” back, k***a.

const include = (arr, item) => arr.includes(item);

// footnotes from a tired roo:
// - strict equality under the hood; '2' isn’t 2, memories aren’t facts
// - NaN? includes handles it properly these days. small mercy.
// - empty list means empty answer. some nights are like that.
