// apple turnover logic, Partridge edition: if x^2 clears 1000, we scream about the sun and leg it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
// Poznań drizzle on the window, Melbourne sun in my head; both hotter than my last romance and twice as confusing
// one night she said “square it, roo,” and I did — numbers fizzed, pastry hissed, life winked
// sometimes love is a molten Bramley jet; could go your way, could go mine; either way, someone’s going down
// if x arrives as a cheeky string, JS still does the maths — like a bartender who doesn’t ask questions
// I swear I’m fine. I’m not fine. I’m fine. k***a.

const apple = x => 
  x ** 2 > 1000 ? `It's hotter than the sun!!`
