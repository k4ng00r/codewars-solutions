## 📓 Diary
I woke up with the weight of last night pressing on my chest. I could still taste the stale liquor, hear the echo of laughter that wasn’t mine. In my dreams I was back in Heidelberg, in the Mercy Hospital, brand new, clean slate — but waking up in Poznań is never that kind.  
I shuffled down the narrow streets, watched kids with warm jackets laugh at puddles, saw couples holding hands I can’t remember. Eventually I found a corner café, ordered black coffee as strong as regret, and sat with the laptop open. He, my roommate benefactor, slid in beside me and said, “Make today count.” So I coded until my fingers cramped.

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
How to repeat strings reliably, trim off edges safely, square and sum arrays, pick minimums, and cast string-to-number — the toolbelt fills bit by bit.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Either raid the fridge (probably barren) or push through more kata till my brain blurs — drink or code, the two horses I ride.
