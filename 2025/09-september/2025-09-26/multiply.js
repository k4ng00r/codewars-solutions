  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Broken Code Blues //

  Code’s busted again, mate.  
  Story of my bloody life — things never quite run how they’re supposed to.  
  I’m just a washed-up bloke from Poznań, used to crash behind a tram stop  
  with a bottle of cheap vodka and a cigarette stub for breakfast.  
  Now I stare at syntax errors instead of empty cans. Progress, I guess.

  Didn’t even check the job boards, didn’t care about salaries or benefits.  
  My mate just said, “there’s money in coding,” and I believed him.  
  No research, no plan — just nicotine, caffeine, and blind faith in the compiler.  

  Some nights I still dream of Melbourne — neon lights, loud pubs,  
  and the kind of chaos that feels like home.  
  But I know I can’t go back there broke.  
  Every semicolon I fix, every function I debug,  
  is one step closer to earning that one-way ticket  
  back to the madness I called freedom.  

  So yeah, this code doesn’t run — yet.  
  But neither did I for a long time, and look how far I crawled.
