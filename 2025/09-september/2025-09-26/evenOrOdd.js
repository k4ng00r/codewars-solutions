  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Even or Odd Confession //

  Even or odd, mate — that’s the question.  
  Funny how life splits the same way: sober or smashed, broke or lucky,  
  sleeping under a bridge in Poznań or dreaming of Melbourne lights.  
  I’ve been both, sometimes in the same bloody week.

  I didn’t start coding ‘cause I love this stuff — nah,  
  a mate told me there’s good cash in it.  
  Didn’t check justjoinit, didn’t care about salaries or stacks.  
  Just needed a reason to quit stealing smokes  
  and maybe buy a ticket back to the chaos that raised me.

  So here I am, checking if numbers are even or odd  
  while checking if my life’s still fixable.  
  You laugh, but to me every console log is one step closer  
  to that bar in Melbourne — neon flicker, cheap beer,  
  and a night where I don’t have to explain myself to anyone.
