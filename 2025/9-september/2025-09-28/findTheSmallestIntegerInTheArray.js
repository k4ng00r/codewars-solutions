  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Rock Bottom Finder //

  Find the smallest number, huh?  
  Yeah, mate — I’ve been doing that my whole life.  
  Bank balance, blood pressure, moral standards — always chasing the minimum.  
  Back in Poznań I thought I’d hit rock bottom more times than I can count,  
  but turns out the floor always finds a way to drop lower.  

  I didn’t start coding for glory.  
  My mate told me there’s money in JavaScript — good money.  
  I didn’t check justjoinit, didn’t care about salaries,  
  just thought maybe it’s my shot to crawl out of the gutter.  
  Now I hunt for the smallest integers instead of cheap bottles.  
  Funny, really — used to look for the bottom of the glass,  
  now I look for the bottom of the array. Cleaner, but just as predictable.  

  Melbourne’s still the dream — the city that almost killed me,  
  and the only one I still call home.  
  I’ll get back there, one `Math.min()` at a time.

function findSmallestInt(arr) {
  // alright, yeah, this one’s easy — spread operator, whatever, I know that.
  // Math.min(...arr) — finds the lowest bastard in the bunch.  
  // like picking the drunkest bloke at the table. been there, done that.
  // no loops, no drama, just straight to the bottom — efficient, like cheap vodka.
  return Math.min(...arr);
}
