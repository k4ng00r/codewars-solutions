  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Double Trouble //

  Double the integer? Mate, if I could double anything,  
  it’d be my beer money and my liver capacity.  
  Back in Melbourne, I used to double-park my dad’s ute outside the casino,  
  thinking I was some kind of genius. Then Sydney happened.  
  Three nights, no sleep, one bad tab, and a bird named Casey  
  who swore she’d teach me JavaScript.  
  Spoiler: she didn’t. She stole my wallet and half my dignity.

  Fast-forward to Poznań. Cold as a tax collector’s heart.  
  I sleep behind a kebab shop, wake up to pigeons judging me.  
  I don’t speak Polish — just “kurwa” and “ty chuju jebany,”  
  which, funny enough, gets me through most conversations.  
  Now I sit in a library with borrowed Wi-Fi,  
  doubling numbers like it’s the only thing keeping me from freezing.  

  Melbourne still feels like a dream,  
  full of beaches, beer, and people who actually smile.  
  Maybe if I keep doubling things long enough,  
  I’ll double back there too.
