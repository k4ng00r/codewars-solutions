  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s First Line of Code //

  “hello world!” — the first words every coder writes,  
  and the first ones I didn’t immediately screw up.  
  Poznań was cold that night — borrowed laptop, half a cigarette,  
  and a coffee that tasted like regret. I typed it, ran it,  
  and for the first time in years something answered back.

  My mate told me there’s money in coding —  
  I didn’t check justjoinit, didn’t even know what a repo was.  
  Just thought maybe “hello world” could be my ticket back to Melbourne.  
  The city I lost myself in… and the one I’m still coding my way toward.  

  Funny thing, mate — you spend your whole life trying to be heard,  
  and it turns out all you needed was a pair of quotes and a return statement.

const greet = () => {
  // yeah, this one’s easy... no loops, no pain, no math — just say hi.
  // the line that starts every journey, even for a washed-up kangaroo like me.
  // whatever happens next, it all begins right here.
  return 'hello world!';
}

// Havin' fun mate? Make me have fun as well.
