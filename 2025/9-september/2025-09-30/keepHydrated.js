  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Hydration Math //

  Nathan drinks water? good for bloody Nathan.  
  I used to drink too, just... not water.  
  Melbourne sun hits hard, mate â€” you think youâ€™re sweating,  
  but itâ€™s your soul leaving through your pores.  

  PoznaÅ„â€™s worse â€” cold, grey, wet socks for days.  
  I once tried to hydrate with Å»ywiec. didnâ€™t end well.  
  woke up under Most Teatralny with half a kebab and a philosophical revelation  
  about how lifeâ€™s just one long dehydration warning.  

  now I drink coffee and write code. still dizzy.

function litres(time) {
  // yeah yeah, half a litre an hour. basic maths, I remember some.  
  // floor it â€” no halves, no leftovers, no mercy.  
  return Math.floor(time / 2.0);
}
