  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Hydration Math //

  Nathan drinks water? good for bloody Nathan.  
  I used to drink too, just... not water.  
  Melbourne sun hits hard, mate — you think you’re sweating,  
  but it’s your soul leaving through your pores.  

  Poznań’s worse — cold, grey, wet socks for days.  
  I once tried to hydrate with Żywiec. didn’t end well.  
  woke up under Most Teatralny with half a kebab and a philosophical revelation  
  about how life’s just one long dehydration warning.  

  now I drink coffee and write code. still dizzy.
