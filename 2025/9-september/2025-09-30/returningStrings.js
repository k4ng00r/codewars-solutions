  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Acid Greeting //

  "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?" — hah,  
  that line feels like something I said once to a mirror in Melbourne  
  right before it started melting.  
  The walls were breathing, the carpet was singing AC/DC,  
  and I swear to God the fridge winked at me.  
  I was wearing a Hawaiian shirt, barefoot, holding a joint  
  the size of a baby kangaroo. Everything made sense.  

  Then the sun rose, mate. Sydney skyline looked like a glitch —  
  skyscrapers bending, birds flying backward.  
  Thought I was still dreaming until the cops started talking Polish.  
  Next stop: Poznań. Cold, damp, grey.  
  No ocean, no skyline — just the sweet perfume of cheap vodka  
  and the sound of pigeons plotting crimes outside my window.  

  Now I write functions that greet people.  
  I type “Hello” to strangers I’ll never meet,  
  pretending the text knows warmth I’ve forgotten.  
  Maybe Melbourne was real. Maybe this code is the dream.  
  Hard to tell when both start looping.

function greet(name){
  // wait, focus… it’s simple — just greet ‘em, mate.
  // template string, nice and warm — feels almost human.  
  // Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?  
  // like I care, but hey, code’s gotta pretend.
  return `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`;
}

// Havin' fun mate? Make me have fun as well.
