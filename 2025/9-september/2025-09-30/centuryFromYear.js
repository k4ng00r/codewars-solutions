  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Time Trip //

  Centuries, huh? bloody hell.  
  I barely remember what I did last Tuesday,  
  and you want me counting hundreds of years?  
  alright, fine. mathâ€™s easier than memory anyway.  

  Back in Melbourne it was always summer â€”  
  girls in ripped jeans, air thick with smoke and noise,  
  beer so cold it made your teeth scream.  
  Sydney burned brighter â€” nights longer than sense.  
  then one wrong trip, one wrong bloke, one wrong drink,  
  and boom â€” welcome to Poland, kurwa jego maÄ‡.  

  PoznaÅ„â€™s got no beaches, no surf, no nothing.  
  just puddles, pigeons and this cold that cuts like broken glass.  
  so I sit here counting fucking centuries  
  like itâ€™ll bring me back to the 21st one I belonged to.  

  timeâ€™s just a dirty loop, mate â€”  
  you round up, move on, pretend itâ€™s progress.

function century(year) {
  // ceil... yeah, round up, like every lie I ever told my parole officer.  
  // year / 100 â€” simple division, clean, cruel, inevitable.  
  // welcome to a new century, same old bullshit.  
  return Math.ceil(year / 100);
}
