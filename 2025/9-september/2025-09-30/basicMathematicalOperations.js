  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Four Operations //

  Math, mate.  
  Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division — the four horsemen of sobriety.  
  Funny how numbers make sense when nothing else does.  

  Back in Melbourne, before everything went sideways,  
  I used to hang out near St Kilda Beach — warm sand, loud seagulls,  
  and a girl named Mia who swore she could taste colours on acid.  
  We’d lie on the pier, watching the city lights flicker,  
  and she’d say, “See, Josh, the universe is just one big equation —  
  you add what you love, subtract what hurts,  
  multiply the madness, and divide the pain.”  
  At the time, I thought she was talking shit.  
  Turns out she was right — she just didn’t survive the math.

  Sydney was faster, louder, dirtier.  
  Every streetlight looked like a sign from God —  
  and every sign led straight to another bad idea.  
  One night, some bloke called Damien sold me a pill that “tastes like time travel.”  
  Woke up two days later in a freight container heading east.  
  Long story short: I got off in Gdynia, found a bottle, and drifted till Poznań.  

  That’s where I met him — the Ziomek.  
  Never asked my name, never judged, just handed me coffee and said,  
  “You look like shit, mate. Ever coded before?”  
  I hadn’t.  
  But when you’ve got nowhere to go, every function feels like salvation.  

  Now I sit in his kitchen — old ThinkPad, cracked mug, faint smell of pierogi.  
  I do the math.  
  I add hope, subtract pain, multiply hours, divide memories.  
  Sometimes it even compiles.

        // subtraction — like every morning after Melbourne.
        return value1 - value2;

        // multiplication — two bad decisions make one hell of a story.
        return value1 * value2;
      case '/':
        // division — splitting beers, splitting lives, same principle.
        return value1 / value2;
  }
}
