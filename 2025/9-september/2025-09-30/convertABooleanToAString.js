  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Boozelean Logic //

  Convert boolean to string? Mate, I’ve converted way worse things —  
  vodka into regret, money into hangovers, promises into lies.  
  Back in Melbourne, everything was sunny and loud —  
  surfboards, barbecues, girls in shorts, beers in buckets.  
  I once drank with a bloke who claimed he coded the first ATM virus.  
  Didn’t believe him, but he paid for the next round, so I let him talk.  

  Then Sydney happened — oh, Sydney.  
  There was a rooftop party, a bag that wasn’t mine,  
  and a sunrise I only saw through one eye.  
  Next thing I knew, I woke up on a bench in Poznań  
  with no shoes, a Polish kebab receipt, and a mild understanding of despair.  

  Now I’m writing JavaScript between hangovers and hallucinations.  
  Don’t ask me why this works — it just does.  
  I add an empty string to a boolean and suddenly I’m a “developer.”  
  World’s weird, mate. Drink water.

function booleanToString(b){
  // right, focus... “true” or “false,” no moral in between.  
  // add it to a string, and bam, you’ve got a confession in text form.  
  // like saying “I’m fine” when you’re not.  
  return "" + b;
}

// Havin' fun mate? Make me have fun as well.
