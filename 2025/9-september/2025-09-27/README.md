## 📓 Diary
I stumbled awake just as the dawn stretched weak light across cracked pavements. My throat scorched from last night’s poison and regret. In Australia I was legend, here I’m a ghost scrambling through alleyways. I shuffled to a kiosk, bought some stale bread, and watched strangers pass me by. Later, the bloke who gave me shelter yesterday poked his head through the door. He muttered about potential, promise, a break, and shoved a laptop in front of me. “Code,” he said. So I did. I coded like a man possessed, trying to drown out the echo of my sins.

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
How to reverse strings, coerce booleans into custom strings, handle negative numbers, and sum arrays conditionally — the basics again, but solid bricks.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Either tiptoe to the fridge (most likely empty) or hammer out more kata until my fingers bleed — coding or drinking, pick your poison.
