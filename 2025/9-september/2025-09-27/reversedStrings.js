  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Reverse Reality //

  Reverse a string, huh? Easy for code â€” harder for life.  
  Iâ€™ve spent years trying to reverse mine:  
  from PoznaÅ„â€™s cold benches back to Melbourneâ€™s warm chaos.  
  From cheap vodka and ashtrays to clean coffee and syntax.  
  But life doesnâ€™t have a built-in .reverse() mate,  
  only late regrets and early hangovers.

  My mate said coding pays, so here I am â€”  
  flipping words instead of coins, trying to make sense of both sides.  
  Didnâ€™t check justjoinit, didnâ€™t care about the numbers.  
  I just know that if I keep coding,  
  maybe one day Iâ€™ll reverse my way home.

function solution(str){
  // Kangarooâ€™s magic trick â€” take the chaos, break it down, flip it, and glue it back together.
  // First, .split("") tears the string apart, like my first marriage.
  // Then .reverse() spins it around â€” dizzy but alive.
  // Finally, .join("") stitches it back into something that almost looks right again.
  return str.split("").reverse().join("");
