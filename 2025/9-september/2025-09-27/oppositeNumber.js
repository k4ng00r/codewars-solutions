  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Opposite Day //

  Find the opposite, huh? Been doing that my whole life, mate.  
  When people went to work, I went to the pub.  
  When they saved money, I spent mine on powder and poison.  
  Poznań’s benches were my office, the bottle my boss.  
  Now I flip numbers instead of flipping my luck —  
  still chasing symmetry in a world that’s all one-sided.  

  My mate said there’s good cash in coding,  
  and I believed him — didn’t check justjoinit, didn’t check a damn thing.  
  Just faith, nicotine, and half a pack of hope.  
  Melbourne still calls me some nights — neon, chaos, and cheap temptation.  
  I’ll get back there one day, but this time with clean code  
  and enough money to buy my own round.  
  Till then, I’ll keep writing opposites — one bug, one memory at a time.

function opposite(number) {
  // Kangaroo’s mirror trick — take whatever life throws at you and flip it.
  // Positive becomes negative, negative becomes positive —
  // just like me: ex-junkie turned junior dev, still debugging his past.
  return -number;
}

// Havin' fun mate? Make me have fun as well.
