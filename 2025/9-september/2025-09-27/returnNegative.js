  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Negative Balance //

  Making numbers negative? Story of my life, mate.  
  Everything I touched in Poznań already came with a minus in front —  
  my bank account, my reputation, my liver.  
  I didn’t learn coding for passion — I learned it ‘cause my mate said  
  there’s good money in it, and I figured, hell, I’ve got nothing left to lose.  
  Never checked justjoinit, didn’t ask about the pay —  
  faith, caffeine, and borrowed Wi-Fi were enough.

  Now I sit here flipping signs on numbers  
  like I’m flipping the script on the life I left behind.  
  Melbourne’s calling, the bars are waiting,  
  but this time I’ll walk in with cash instead of excuses.  
  Until then — every bug fixed, every number reversed —  
  that’s one more drink closer to going home.

function makeNegative(num) {
  // Kangaroo’s logic — if life gives you positives, turn ‘em upside down.

// Havin' fun mate? Make me have fun as well.
