  // ğŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Negative Balance //

  Making numbers negative? Story of my life, mate.  
  Everything I touched in PoznaÅ„ already came with a minus in front â€”  
  my bank account, my reputation, my liver.  
  I didnâ€™t learn coding for passion â€” I learned it â€˜cause my mate said  
  thereâ€™s good money in it, and I figured, hell, Iâ€™ve got nothing left to lose.  
  Never checked justjoinit, didnâ€™t ask about the pay â€”  
  faith, caffeine, and borrowed Wi-Fi were enough.

  Now I sit here flipping signs on numbers  
  like Iâ€™m flipping the script on the life I left behind.  
  Melbourneâ€™s calling, the bars are waiting,  
  but this time Iâ€™ll walk in with cash instead of excuses.  
  Until then â€” every bug fixed, every number reversed â€”  
  thatâ€™s one more drink closer to going home.
