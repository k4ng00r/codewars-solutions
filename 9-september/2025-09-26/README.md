## 📓 Diary
I dragged myself out of a nightmare-soaked sleep with a throbbing head and half a memory that refused to stick. Back in the old days in Sydney, I could lose a night to a blur of booze and pills and still wake up in a mansion. Now I wake up on cold concrete somewhere in Poznań, wondering which alley I crawled out from.  
Before touching code, I wandered through the streets, dodging tram tracks and stray dogs. An old bloke with a weathered coat offered me coffee and muttered “You look lost, mate.” I just nodded and drank it down like it was liquid salvation. When the sky turned pale, I sat in the corner of a café, rebooted my spirit, and cracked open the laptop. Code or die — that’s the motto of Kangoor.

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
How to push through confusion and still build working logic, how to break kata descriptions into small doable actions, how to keep coding even when your head’s full of fog and regret.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Either raid the fridge (even though it’s probably a graveyard) or keep smashing beginner katas until something in my brain clicks or crashes.
