  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Number Game //

  Turning numbers into strings, huh?  
  Back in PoznaÅ„ I was turning cheap vodka into bad decisions,  
  and coins into cigarettes. Different kind of conversion, same technique â€”  
  desperation and a bit of math.  

  My mate told me thereâ€™s money in coding,  
  so I stopped counting bottles and started counting characters.  
  Never checked justjoinit, didnâ€™t care about the pay â€”  
  I just knew that every bug I fix is a shot closer  
  to the Melbourne nights I left behind.  

  Itâ€™s funny, you know â€”  
  all Iâ€™m doing now is wrapping cold numbers in quotes  
  so they look a bit more human.  
  Guess Iâ€™ve been doing that to myself for years.
