  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Even or Odd Confession //

  Even or odd, mate â€” thatâ€™s the question.  
  Funny how life splits the same way: sober or smashed, broke or lucky,  
  sleeping under a bridge in PoznaÅ„ or dreaming of Melbourne lights.  
  Iâ€™ve been both, sometimes in the same bloody week.

  I didnâ€™t start coding â€˜cause I love this stuff â€” nah,  
  a mate told me thereâ€™s good cash in it.  
  Didnâ€™t check justjoinit, didnâ€™t care about salaries or stacks.  
  Just needed a reason to quit stealing smokes  
  and maybe buy a ticket back to the chaos that raised me.

  So here I am, checking if numbers are even or odd  
  while checking if my lifeâ€™s still fixable.  
  You laugh, but to me every console log is one step closer  
  to that bar in Melbourne â€” neon flicker, cheap beer,  
  and a night where I donâ€™t have to explain myself to anyone.
