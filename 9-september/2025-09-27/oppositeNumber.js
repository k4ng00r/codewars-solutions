/*
  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Opposite Day //

  Find the opposite, huh? Been doing that my whole life, mate.  
  When people went to work, I went to the pub.  
  When they saved money, I spent mine on powder and poison.  
  PoznaÅ„â€™s benches were my office, the bottle my boss.  
  Now I flip numbers instead of flipping my luck â€”  
  still chasing symmetry in a world thatâ€™s all one-sided.  

  My mate said thereâ€™s good cash in coding,  
  and I believed him â€” didnâ€™t check justjoinit, didnâ€™t check a damn thing.  
  Just faith, nicotine, and half a pack of hope.  
  Melbourne still calls me some nights â€” neon, chaos, and cheap temptation.  
  Iâ€™ll get back there one day, but this time with clean code  
  and enough money to buy my own round.  
  Till then, Iâ€™ll keep writing opposites â€” one bug, one memory at a time.

function opposite(number) {
  // Kangarooâ€™s mirror trick â€” take whatever life throws at you and flip it.
  // Positive becomes negative, negative becomes positive â€”
  // just like me: ex-junkie turned junior dev, still debugging his past.
  return -number;
}
