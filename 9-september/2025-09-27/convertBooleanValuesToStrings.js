  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Yes or No Philosophy //

  True or false, yes or no — life’s just a boolean with a hangover, mate.  
  I’ve said “yes” to all the wrong things: cheap vodka, bad women,  
  and enough smokes to make a chimney jealous.  
  Said “no” to the right ones too — jobs, rehab, love.  
  That’s the trick, innit? The logic’s easy in code,  
  but in life, everything’s a maybe wrapped in a mistake.  

  I didn’t start coding because I cared —  
  my mate in Melbourne told me there’s money in it,  
  and I thought, “why not?” Never checked justjoinit, didn’t care about the range.  
  I just knew that if I kept pressing keys long enough,  
  maybe I’d buy myself back to the chaos that raised me.  

  So yeah, now I write functions that say “Yes” or “No”  
  — simple answers for a bloke who’s had none for years.

  // If it’s false, say “No” and light a cig.  
  // There’s no maybe in this code, mate — that’s for philosophers and ex-girlfriends.
  return bool ? "Yes" : "No";
