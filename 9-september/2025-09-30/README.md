## 📓 Diary
Woke up when the sky was still half asleep, the city sound muted like me after last night’s bottle. I used to be Kangoor Joshua Brown, big in Australia, living five-star, beaches, bikinis, the whole circus. Now I’m Kangur, dodging cold pavements in Poznań, holding a coffee cup like it’s the last lifeline. The bloke who found me in a dumpster handed me a laptop and said: *“Start typing or stay broken.”* I chose the keys. The room stank of yesterday, but the screen glowed like promise. I let the code pull me out of the mess.

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
Converting booleans to strings, crafting template greetings, dispatching arithmetic operations, rounding logic for hydration, and calculating centuries — weird little bricks building weird little roots.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Might wander to the fridge (though probably empty), might indulge in one more drink to smooth out the ache, or dive into the next stack of kata until the city noise fades and only the keys click.
