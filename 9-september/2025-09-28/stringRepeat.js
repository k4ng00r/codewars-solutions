  Repeat a string, eh? Yeah, I’ve done that before —  
  mostly “I’ll quit tomorrow” and “just one more drink.”  
  Back in Poznań I used to repeat the same day on loop:  
  wake up on concrete, find a cig, find a reason, find a bottle.  

  My mate said there’s good money in coding,  
  and I thought, hell, why not repeat that too.  
  Didn’t check justjoinit, didn’t care — faith, caffeine, and a hangover were enough.  
  Now I’m looping strings instead of bad habits. Cleaner syntax, same despair.  

  Funny thing — code doesn’t judge you for doing the same thing over and over.  
  It just runs it. Predictable. Reliable.  
  If life worked like that, I’d already be back in Melbourne  
  with a smoke, a cold beer, and no regrets left to repeat.

function repeatStr (n, s) {
  // alright so yeah... s.repeat(n)...  
  // it’s literally built in, no tricks, no loops — even I can’t screw this up.  
  // you give it a string, tell it how many times to echo — bam, done.  
  // cleaner than my criminal record after community service.  
  return s.repeat(n);
