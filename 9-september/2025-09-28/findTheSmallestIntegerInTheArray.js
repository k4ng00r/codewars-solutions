  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Rock Bottom Finder //

  Find the smallest number, huh?  
  Yeah, mate â€” Iâ€™ve been doing that my whole life.  
  Bank balance, blood pressure, moral standards â€” always chasing the minimum.  
  Back in PoznaÅ„ I thought Iâ€™d hit rock bottom more times than I can count,  
  but turns out the floor always finds a way to drop lower.  

  I didnâ€™t start coding for glory.  
  My mate told me thereâ€™s money in JavaScript â€” good money.  
  I didnâ€™t check justjoinit, didnâ€™t care about salaries,  
  just thought maybe itâ€™s my shot to crawl out of the gutter.  
  Now I hunt for the smallest integers instead of cheap bottles.  
  Funny, really â€” used to look for the bottom of the glass,  
  now I look for the bottom of the array. Cleaner, but just as predictable.  

  Melbourneâ€™s still the dream â€” the city that almost killed me,  
  and the only one I still call home.  
  Iâ€™ll get back there, one `Math.min()` at a time.
