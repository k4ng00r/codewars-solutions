  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Slice of Life //

  Remove the first and last characters?  
  Mate, thatâ€™s basically what life did to me already.  
  Took the start, chopped off the end, left me somewhere in the middle â€”  
  half-broken, half-sober, still running on caffeine and regret.  

  Back in PoznaÅ„, mornings started with a smoke and ended in confusion.  
  Now I cut strings instead of cutting people off. Cleaner business.  
  My mate told me coding pays well â€” didnâ€™t check justjoinit,  
  didnâ€™t check the rates, just believed him like an idiot with a dream.  
  Melbourneâ€™s still waiting for me â€” the bars, the chaos, the ocean breeze.  
  Every `.slice()` I write gets me a millimetre closer to that one-way flight.  

  Some nights I look at my code and think:  
  yeah, weâ€™re not so different â€” both missing a few parts,  
  but still doing the job somehow.

  // okay, easy one... if itâ€™s only two characters, we nuke the whole thing.  
  // just return an empty string â€” like my fridge on a Monday morning.  
  if (str.length == 2) return '';
  
  // slice(1, -1)... yeah, yeah, I know â€” start after the first, stop before the last.  
  // like trimming the crust off a sandwich, or cutting toxic people from your life.  
  // itâ€™s neat, itâ€™s clean, it works... whatever, next task.
  else return str.slice(1, -1);
