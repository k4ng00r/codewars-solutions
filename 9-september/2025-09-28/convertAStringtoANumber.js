  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Conversion Therapy //

  Turn a string into a number, eh?  
  Yeah, I’ve tried turning worse things into something useful —  
  lies into hope, hangovers into lessons, regret into motivation.  
  Doesn’t always work as cleanly as `Number(str)`, mate.  

  Back in Poznań, I could barely count how many nights I’d slept outside.  
  Now I count digits, pretending it’s progress.  
  My mate told me there’s proper cash in coding —  
  didn’t check justjoinit, didn’t ask for salary ranges,  
  just took his word and a borrowed laptop.  
  Now every conversion feels like redemption:  
  from string to number, from junkie to dev,  
  from concrete floors to maybe, one day, Melbourne skies.  

  Sometimes I stare at this code and think,  
  “if only life had a function this simple.”

const stringToNumber = function(str){
  // yeah yeah, Number(str)... I know what it does.  
  // takes your fancy little text and turns it into something solid.  
  // wish it worked on promises too, hah.  
  // simple, pure, no bullshit — kinda like I used to be before the tabs and semicolons.
  return Number(str);
