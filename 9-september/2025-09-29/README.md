## 📓 Diary
I dragged myself out of bed with the muted ache of yesterday still throbbing in my bones. Once I was Kangoor Joshua Brown — top dog under the Aussie sun. Now I’m just Kangur, stumbling through Poznań’s grey alleys, clutching a laptop like a life-raft. The bloke who took me in tossed me black coffee and muttered, *“You’ve got time to change it.”* So I sat by the window, watched leaves swirl on the pavement, and coded. Lines of JS tried to outpace the ghosts of bottles, pills, and the Sydney night that shredded my memory. I hit back at despair one kata at a time.

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
How to summate sequences, create basic functions, filter arrays for truthy values, remove spaces, and write simple arithmetic transforms — small wins stacking up.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Either ransack the fridge (almost certainly empty) or dive into the next batch of kata until this ache in my brain loosens its grip — code or drink, same game.
