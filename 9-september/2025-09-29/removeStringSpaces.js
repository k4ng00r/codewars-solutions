  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Space Remover //

  Remove the spaces, huh?  
  Wish I could do that with memories too, mate.  
  Back in Poznań, there was this girl — Ola? Or maybe Olya?  
  Met her outside a Żabka at 3 a.m., she had a lighter and I had regrets.  
  We shared both.  

  Anyway, she said I talked too slow — “too many spaces between your words,” she laughed.  
  Now look at me, removing them professionally.  
  My mate told me there’s money in coding —  
  didn’t check justjoinit, didn’t care about the pay —  
  I just knew if I keep deleting enough white space from my life,  
  maybe I’ll finally make it back to Melbourne.  

  Each `.replace()` feels like sweeping up another mess I made.  
  Cleaner code, cleaner conscience — for now.

function noSpace(x){
  // yeah yeah, regex magic. \s means “spacey stuff”, g means “get all the bastards”.
  // replace ‘em with nothing — kinda like my ex replacing me with her new guy.  
  // return the cleaned-up string, looking tight and sober, unlike me on Fridays.
  return x.replace(/\s/g, '');
}
