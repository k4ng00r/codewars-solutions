// Late tram in Poznań, paper bag of symbols in my lap — I thread them like beads,
// comma, breath, comma, breath — a tiny parade that doesn’t judge where you came from. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
// Flashback: Melbourne boardwalk, gulls screaming "hola" in pieces; I add commas so they march in step.
const printArray = array => array.join(',');
// If the bag holds booleans, numbers, even moody objects — fine. I don’t preach, I just line them up and click. ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
