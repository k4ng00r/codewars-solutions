  Midnight bus stop, Poznań drizzle. Words in my head are walking the wrong way down the street.
  Trick is simple: line them up, spin them around, and send them home in reverse order.
  Like leaving a club through the entrance you swore you'd never use again. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

  Mini-timeline:
  • Evening: "Hello World" feels brave and forward.
  • Night: it flips — "World Hello" — same pieces, new story.
  • Morning: coffee, silence, messages rewritten, fewer regrets.

  Notes from the road:
  • We split on a single space, because tonight everyone arrives one by one.
  • Then we reverse the parade and stitch it back together.
  • Trailing spaces? The bouncer usually ignores stragglers — the kata says we can, so we do.

const reverse = string => string.split(' ').reverse().join(' ');

  Flashback:
  Sydney boardwalk at dawn — gulls heckle, tide rewrites footprints in reverse.
  Code does the same to sentences. Different order, same truth. Calm returns. ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
