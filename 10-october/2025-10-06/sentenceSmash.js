// 4 AM. cold kitchen. cigarette burns on the table from nights that never ended.
// Kangur’s staring at an empty array of memories, trying to smash them back into something that sounds like a sentence.
// words, just words. they used to mean things back in Melbourne.

function smash (words) {
   // I could loop, I could struggle, but who am I kidding — life’s already one big join(' ')
   // every word’s a little drunk, every space a breath between regrets
   return words.join(' ');
   // simple, clean, merciless. like vodka. like loneliness. like JavaScript pretending to be poetry.
};

// in Poland, I smash bottles, not arrays. but both make noise.
// and when I join all my broken thoughts, I still end up with one sad, beautiful sentence:
// “hello world this is great” — the most tragic lie ever written in code.
