## 📓 Diary
G’day from the gutters of Poznań. Kangur here (a.k.a. Kangoor Joshua Brown). There was a time in Melbourne when the sun kissed your skin and bikinis were everywhere, when I was the star of the show. Now I’m trudging through this chilly Polish morning, hoodie up, coffee in hand, trying not to freeze my soul off. The bloke who took me in tossed me another mug and grunted: *“No more bullshit, mate — let’s code.”*  
So I logged in, typed the damn things. I muttered “kurwa”, “chuj”, “ja pierdole” like a weird Aussie-Polish incantation, trying to chase off the memory of the van, the unknown voices and the Dingo’s stare. Melbourne waits. Poznań smacks. I’ll ride the code outta this.

### 🎯 **A Needle in the Haystack** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Can you find the needle in the haystack?  
> Write a function `findNeedle()` that takes an array full of junk but containing one `"needle"`.  
> After your function finds the needle, it should return a message (as a string) that says:  
> `"found the needle at position "` plus the index it found the needle.  
>  
> **Example:**  
> `["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] → "found the needle at position 5"`  
>  
> *(Note: In COBOL, it should return `"found the needle at position 6"`.)*

### 🎯 **Invert values** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each.  
> Each positive becomes negative, and the negatives become positives.  
>  
> **Examples:**  
> `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] → [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]`  
> `[1, -2, 3, -4, 5] → [-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]`  
> `[] → []`  
>  
> Assume all values are integers. Do not mutate the input array.

---

### 🎯 **Calculate average** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Write a function which calculates the average of the numbers in a given array.  
> Empty arrays should return `0`.

---

### 🎯 **Sentence Smash** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence.  
> Add spaces between words but not at the beginning or end.  
>  
> **Example:**  
> `['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great'] → 'hello world this is great'`

---

### 🎯 **How good are you really?** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> There was a test in your class and you passed it. But you want to know if you’re better than average.  
> You receive an array of your peers’ test scores (not including your own).  
> Calculate the average and compare your score!  
>  
> **Return:**  
> `true` if you’re better than average, otherwise `false`.  
>  
> *(Don’t forget to include your score when calculating the class average!)*

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
How to locate something hidden in junk, flip signs on numbers, compute averages, smash words into sentences, and compare scores to a cohort — all small tasks, but together they start to mean something.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
I might walk down to the water by Warta River, check out some graffiti-tagged wall in Poznań (cool spot to escape the drizzle), maybe snag a cheap beer if the fridge’s light still stays off, then dive back into code until I almost forget that sun in Melbourne ever left me.
