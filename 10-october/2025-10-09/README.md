## 📓 Diary
Woke up to Poznań doing its favorite impression of a damp dishcloth while Melbourne flexed with a smug patch of blue sky. Tram brakes squealed, pigeons judged, and my coffee tasted like someone rinsed a moka pot with regret. Still, the cursor blinked like a metronome, and I marched to its beat.

I wrote tiny functions with big attitudes. Loops lined up like soldiers, arrays stacked like beer crates, and that rock-paper-scissors logic reminded me of Sydney beach politics: scissors are flashy until rock shows up. Between commits I daydreamed of St Kilda sun and the sound of gulls stealing chips. Then I looked back at the drizzle and doubled down on the plan: code hard, keep the story moving, earn that ticket home.

Tonight’s promise to myself: small wins stacked into a wall. One brick is boring. A thousand bricks is a bridge.

### 🎯 **Count by X**
> **Description:**  
> Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first n multiples of x.  
>  
> Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.  
>  
> Return the results as an array or list ( depending on language ).  
>  
> **Examples**  
> x = 1, n = 10 --> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]  
> x = 2, n = 5 --> [2,4,6,8,10]

---

### 🎯 **Reversed sequence**
> **Description:**  
> Build a function that returns an array of integers from n to 1 where n>0.  
>  
> **Example :** n=5 --> [5,4,3,2,1]

---

### 🎯 **Rock Paper Scissors!**
> **Description:**  
> Rules of the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game are:  
>  
> Rock beats Scissors  
> Scissors beat Paper,  
> Paper beats Rock.  
> Let's play! You have to return which player won! In case of a draw return Draw!.  
>  
> **Examples:**  
> "scissors", "paper" --> "Player 1 won!"  
> "scissors", "rock" --> "Player 2 won!"  
> "paper", "paper" --> "Draw!"

---

### 🎯 **If you can't sleep, just count sheep!!**
> **Description:**  
> If you can't sleep, just count sheeps!!  
>  
> **Task:**  
> Given a non-negative integer, 3 for example, return a string with a murmur: "1 sheep...2 sheep...3 sheep...". Input will always be valid, i.e. no negative integers.

---

### 🎯 **Grasshopper - Grade book**
> **Description:**  
> Grade book  
> Complete the function so that it finds the average of the three scores passed to it and returns the letter value associated with that grade.  
>  
> **Numerical Score Letter Grade**  
> 90 <= score <= 100 'A'  
> 80 <= score < 90 'B'  
> 70 <= score < 80 'C'  
> 60 <= score < 70 'D'  
> 0 <= score < 60 'F'  
> Tested values are all between 0 and 100. Theres is no need to check for negative values or values greater than 100.

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
- Built muscle memory for generating sequences both forward and backward, with tidy loops and off-by-one discipline.  
- Practiced conditional branching that reads cleanly, especially in simple game logic where clarity beats cleverness.  
- String assembly patterns: incremental concatenation for “sheep” counters without trailing junk.  
- Averaging and grading with explicit range guards to avoid fencepost mistakes.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Refill the mug, throw on a lo-fi playlist, and refactor today’s snippets into bite-size utilities. If Poznań keeps leaking from the sky, I’ll treat it like a timer: one focused kata per rain burst, a brisk walk between showers, then back to the terminal. Melbourne sun can wait; my ticket is buried somewhere between functions, tests, and a stubborn savings plan.
