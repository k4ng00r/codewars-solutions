## 📓 Diary
Righto mate, woke up in Poznań with the same bitter taste of yesterday’s nothing-burger in my mouth. Australia seems like a different lifetime: golden beaches, bikinis, opera house lights. Now my puddle in Poznań laughs back with every soggy footstep. Meanwhile, Melbourne’s sun-lit shore flickers in memory—warm, free, alive. The bloke who still lets me crash handed me a damp towel and a nod: *“Get to it.”* I gulped awful Polish coffee, logged in, started typing. Each kata is my escape hatch, each function a chance to resurrect Kangoor from the gutter.

### 🎯 **Sum Arrays** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Write a function that takes an array of numbers (which may include negative or non-integer values) and returns the sum.  
> If the array is empty, return `0`.  
> **Example:**  
> `[1, 5.2, 4, 0, -1] → 9.2`

---

### 🎯 **Convert number to reversed array of digits** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Given a non-negative number, return its digits in an array in reverse order.  
> **Examples:**  
> `35231 → [1, 3, 2, 5, 3]`  
> `0 → [0]`

---

### 🎯 **Opposites Attract** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Given two numbers representing flower petals, return `true` if one is even and the other odd, otherwise `false`.

---

### 🎯 **Beginner – Lost Without a Map** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.  
> **Example:**  
> `[1, 2, 3] → [2, 4, 6]`

---

### 🎯 **Beginner Series #1 – School Paperwork** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> You have `n` classmates and paperwork with `m` pages each.  
> Return how many blank pages are needed (`n × m`).  
> If either `n < 0` or `m < 0`, return `0`.

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
Summing arrays even when numbers refuse to behave, reversing digits like I reverse my luck, knowing when odd meets even, doubling values like doubling down when I should’ve stopped, and handling paperwork like the life responsibilities I keep ignoring.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Could wander the streets of Poznań, find some neat little hidden café (if I’m lucky), or raid the fridge (spoiler: almost empty), crack open another coffee, maybe light a smoke and trawl through code until the sun sets and my brain forgets the screams of yesterday.
