/*
  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Sum of Sorrows //

  You ever try adding up your bad decisions?  
  Thatâ€™s basically what this function does, mate.  
  Every pint, every night on the park bench, every missed flight â€”  
  reduce() just stacks â€™em up till you hit zero again.  

  Empty array? Thatâ€™s the sober phase â€” nothing to sum, nothing to lose.  
  Negative numbers? Thatâ€™s the debt collectors calling.  
  But hey, it still works.  
  Codeâ€™s honest â€” unlike half the blokes I used to drink with in Fitzroy.

function sum (numbers) {
  // start from zero â€” like my bank account on a Monday.
  const initialValue = 0;

  // keep piling it up â€” every shot, every sin, every digit.
  return numbers.reduce(
    (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue,
    initialValue,
  );
}
