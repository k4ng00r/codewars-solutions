  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Love Algorithm //

  They say loveâ€™s complicated â€” nah mate, itâ€™s just math with worse hangovers.  
  You got one even, one odd â€” opposites attract, like me and sobriety.  
  Two evens? Dead vibes. Two odds? Chaos, but not the good kind.  

  This bit of code? Itâ€™s romance distilled.  
  Itâ€™s algebra wearing a leather jacket, lighting a smoke behind a pub in Carlton.  
  You think itâ€™s overkill? Maybe. But so was falling in love with a bartender named Casey in Sydney.  
  Point is â€” the logicâ€™s flawless, just like me after my fifth beer.  
  The worldâ€™ll catch up one day. Till then, Iâ€™ll keep coding love like itâ€™s destiny.

function lovefunc(flower1, flower2){
  // one even, one odd â€” if that ainâ€™t poetry, I donâ€™t know what is.
  if (((flower1%2 == 0) && (flower2%2 != 0)) || ((flower1%2 != 0) && (flower2%2 == 0))) {
    return true; // true love, mate
  } else {
    return false; // nah, just another mistake
  }
}
