  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Pet Math //

  Cats and dogs, mate.  
  I used to live with a stray cat in PoznaÅ„ â€” mean bastard, always stole my sausages.  
  Never thought Iâ€™d end up calculating animal years instead of counting empty bottles.  

  My mate told me thereâ€™s good cash in coding.  
  Didnâ€™t check justjoinit, didnâ€™t even know what a framework was â€”  
  just believed him, because beliefâ€™s cheaper than therapy.  
  Now I sit here sober-ish, writing functions about pets that age better than I did.  

  Fifteen years first round, nine next,  
  then you just keep adding â€” same as life, but with less hangover.  
  Cats age faster, dogs love harder,  
  and me? Iâ€™m still trying to catch up with both.
