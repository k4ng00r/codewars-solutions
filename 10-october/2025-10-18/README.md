## 📓 Diary
I rolled out of some cheap mattress somewhere in Poznań with the memory of my “royal kangaroo” days in Australia still buzzing in my head. Kangoor Joshua Brown they called me once, surrounded by beaches, bikinis and opera lights in Sydney. Now I’m here – broken transport, broken dreams, but still typing. The bloke who let me crash at his place handed me a coffee and whispered *“Make it count tonight.”* So I opened the laptop, reminded myself that despite the alcohol and the pills and the wilderness, the code is my ticket back. My fingers drank the keyboard.

### 🎯 **altERnaTIng cAsE <=> ALTerNAtiNG CaSe** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Define a function so that each lowercase letter becomes uppercase and each uppercase letter becomes lowercase.  
> Non-letter characters should stay the same.

---

### 🎯 **Cat years, Dog years** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Given `humanYears >= 1`, return `[humanYears, catYears, dogYears]` where:  
> - `catYears = 15` for the first year + `9` for the second + `4 * (remaining years)`  
> - `dogYears = 15` for the first year + `9` for the second + `5 * (remaining years)`

### 🎯 **Correct the mistakes of the character recognition software** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Correct the mis-recognized characters in a string:  
> Replace `5 → S`, `0 → O`, `1 → I`.  
> The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.

---

### 🎯 **Is it a palindrome?** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Write a function that checks if a given string (case insensitive) is a palindrome —  
> reads the same backwards and forwards.

---

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
How to flip character cases alternatingly, calculate animal year conversions, fix OCR-style text errors, and detect palindromes — stacking up the essentials.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Either raid the fridge (likely empty) or smash through the next batch of kata until the ache in my head dulls — coding or drinking, whichever bites first.
