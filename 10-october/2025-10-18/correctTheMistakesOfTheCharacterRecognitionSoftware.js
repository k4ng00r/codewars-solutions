  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s OCR Fixer //

  Ah, classic machine fuck-ups â€” reminds me of my own mornings.  
  Back when I lived under the bridge in PoznaÅ„,  
  I couldnâ€™t tell a 5 from an S either.  
  Eyes blurry, head pounding, mind full of static â€”  
  now I fix computers for making the same mistake. Ironic, huh?  

  My mate told me thereâ€™s cash in coding â€” I didnâ€™t check justjoinit,  
  didnâ€™t even ask what OCR stood for.  
  Just started typing till things stopped breaking.  
  These days I patch typos for a living and call it progress.  
  Melbourne still feels like a dream â€”  
  bright lights, loud pubs, and no one asking if Iâ€™m alright.  
  Iâ€™ll get there. One regex at a time.

const correct = string =>
  // replace... yeah yeah, regex time. brain hurts but letâ€™s go.  
  // [015] â€” thatâ€™s zero, one, five. the usual suspects.  
  // callback replaces each one using the tiny lookup object â€” clever shit.  
  // 0 becomes O, 1 becomes I, 5 becomes S â€” simple, pure, caffeine-proof.  
  // clean enough to pass tests, messy enough to feel like my handwriting.
  string.replace(/[015]/g, c => ({ '0': 'O', '1': 'I', '5': 'S' }[c]));
