  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Square Function //

  Yeah mate, they want me to “return the square.”  
  Funny thing, I used to sleep on a square — bit of cardboard behind a servo in Poznań, Poland.  
  Back then I didn’t return anything, not even favours.  
  Ciggies, cheap bourbon, and the occasional thrill — that was the loop I lived in.  

  Now I square numbers instead of debts.  
  They say coding’s a cleaner addiction, but I still keep a bottle under the desk  
  and a smoke for when the math gets heavy.  
  Life’s strange — one day you’re a junkie with no shoes,  
  next day you’re calculating powers for beer money.  
  Ain’t progress, mate — it’s just survival with syntax.
