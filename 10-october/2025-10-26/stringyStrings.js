// I keep the strobe in my pocket for nights when Poznań won’t blink back, a soft little pattern that outlives the bouncer and the rain.
// It starts with a 1 because something has to start with courage; then 0, like the tray of shot glasses when the bar tab dies;
// then 1 again because I remember why I left Melbourne; then 0 because Żabka is closed and I lied to myself, again.
// I walk past Schron and the sidewalk hums binary, a thin rope I can hold while the bass tries to pry open my skull.
// At Piwna Stopa I promised myself one beer, and the city laughed, low and patient, as if it knew my algorithm better than I do.
// I’m not chaos, I tell the puddles, I’m a loop with feelings: size in, pattern out, toggling the lights until morning forgets my name.
// Fill it all with 1s like bravado at 21:03, then every odd step drops to 0 like the message you never send when you should;
// join it without spaces, because who has room for silence when trams are late and the wallet wheezes like a busted kettle.
// Minimal sober math, even for a cooked marsupial: index 0 stays 1, index 1 falls to 0, index 2 remembers the anthem, index 3 apologises, kurwa.
// If the size is 6, the city chants 101010; if it’s 4, the neon cuts at 1010; give me 12 and I’ll count streetlights home: 101010101010.
// I still carry the boat-cruise scar shaped like a semicolon, a reminder that the line ends only when I say so; pause; continue.
// I tried salsa at Cuba Libre, left foot 1, right foot 0, partner sighing like a linter, but I compiled, barely.
// In Pacha the velvet ropes judged me for debugging in a jacket that smelled like hot-dog and cheap survival, and I nodded like a bug report.
// Morning at Blask tastes like second chances; Miel forgives more slowly; Strag just pours the truth and lets me sit with it.
// A therapist once told me to give my nights a structure; I wrote this string instead, the smallest raft I know: start with 1, earn your zeros, don’t drown.
// And when the dawn finally peels me off the pavement, the pattern keeps walking in my head, a soft metronome that never lies unless I do.

const stringy = size => Array(size).fill(1).map((n, i) => i % 2 ? n - 1 : n).join('');

// Breathe. Count. Ship it. If I can hold 1,0,1,0 in my mouth without dropping it, I can make it to coffee and maybe further.
// If the test fails, I’ll sweep the floor of Proletaryat and call it penance; if it passes, I’ll pretend I planned it this way.
// Either way the string knows the way home, and tonight that’s enough.
//
// Havin' fun mate? Make me have fun as well.
// I know the page's called Buy Me a Coffee, but I won't lie.
