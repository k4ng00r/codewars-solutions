Mate, this one’s a piss-easy gig — multiply by eight if it’s even, nine if it’s odd.  
Kids’ stuff. But here I am, half-dead, trying to remember where I left my lighter.  
You know, back when I still had a flat in Melbourne, math was something accountants did.  
Now it’s just another hustle — numbers instead of bottles, loops instead of lines.  

My mate told me there’s good cash in coding. Didn’t even check justjoinit,  
just nodded like a fool and thought, “Yeah, reckon that’ll buy me a ticket back home.”  
Now I’m stuck here, drunk on instant coffee, coding between ashtrays.  
Eight for the even, nine for the rest — like flipping coins to see if you’re sober or not.  

Anyway, don’t overthink it. The logic’s cleaner than my conscience after rehab.

function simpleMultiplication(number) {
    // alright, so eeeehh, modulo two, yeah, I remember this — odd or even, right?
    // yeah, if remainder’s got teeth, that means odd. If it’s clean, even.
    // even ones get 8x, 'cause they’re boring, stable, go to work and pay rent.
    // odd ones? they get 9x — chaotic, unpredictable, like waking up in Żabka’s backroom.
    // i mean, who the hell writes this stuff? whatever, it works.
  return (number % 2) ? (number * 9) : (number * 8); // ternary voodoo — looks fancy, does nothing special.
                                                     // yeah yeah, multiply, return, profit, repeat. life’s just loops, mate.
