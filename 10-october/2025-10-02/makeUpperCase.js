Yeah, this one’s pure rocket science.  
Take some text, scream it back in uppercase — instant authority.  
You could be whispering sweet nothings, and after this function, it sounds like a hostage demand.  

Technically, `.toUpperCase()` just maps every lowercase character to its capital cousin.  
Doesn’t fix your life choices, doesn’t clean your code — just yells louder.  
Perfect for emails, angry tweets, or confessing love when sober courage runs low.

  return str.toUpperCase(); // done. loud, proud, and probably unnecessary — like most people on the internet
