## 📓 Diary
G’day mates, it’s me — Kangur (well, technically Kangoor Joshua Brown) reporting from the weeds of Poznań. Picture this: a time back in Melbourne, sun blazing, girls in bikinis, the waves whispering my name. Now I’m getting slapped by autumn wind and the stench of yesterday’s bottles in a Polish alley.  
Woke up freezing, the bloke who helped me handed me coffee and chuckled, *“Mate, you’re still alive — codes await.”* I clutched that laptop like it was my surfboard heading into a rogue wave. Melbourne’s sun still warm in memory, Poznań’s grey coat all over my shoulders. Today I typed, I swore (“kurwa”, “ja pierdole”, “chuj” — yeah I know ’em, barely), battled the old me, the party me, the broke me. Code is lean, code is new life.

## 🧩 Codewars Katas

---

### 🎯 **MakeUpperCase** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Write a function which converts the input string to uppercase.

---

### 🎯 **Simple multiplication** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Multiply a given number by eight if it is even, and by nine otherwise.

---

### 🎯 **Are You Playing Banjo?** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Create a function that answers the question *“Are you playing banjo?”*  
> If your name starts with the letter “R” or lowercase “r”, you are playing banjo!  
> The function takes a name as its only argument and returns:  
> - `"<name> plays banjo"`  
> - `"<name> does not play banjo"`  
> Names given are always valid strings.

---

### 🎯 **Beginner Series #2 Clock** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> The clock shows `h` hours, `m` minutes, and `s` seconds after midnight.  
> Write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.  
> **Example:** `h=0, m=1, s=1 → result=61000`  
> **Input constraints:** `0 ≤ h ≤ 23`, `0 ≤ m ≤ 59`, `0 ≤ s ≤ 59`.

---

### 🎯 **Abbreviate a Two Word Name** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Write a function to convert a name into initials.  
> This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.  
> Output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.  
> **Examples:**  
> `Sam Harris → S.H`  
> `patrick feeney → P.F`

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
How to convert strings to uppercase, branch logic on even/odd multiplications, detect names for banjo duty, convert clock time to milliseconds, and abbreviate two-word names — the small stuff that builds bigger stuff.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Might wander to the Old Market Square in Poznań, maybe find a graffiti-laden lane that reminds me of Melbourne’s laneways under sunset, grab a cold one if the fridge shows mercy, then crack back into code until the Aussie sun flickers in my mind again.
