## 📓 Diary
G’day — it’s Kangur (aka Kangoor Joshua Brown) checking in from the cold concrete of Poznań. Melbourne’s sun still rides high in my mind: beach, bikinis, surfboard under one arm, freedom under the Aussie light. Here in Poznań? The clouds sponge up the day and I’m wrapped in a hoodie like I’m trying to block out the world.  
Woke up after another restless night, the taste of stale beer in my mouth and memories of Sydney’s lights flickering like ghosts. My mate-backer handed me a hot cup and muttered: *“Let’s see you fight today.”* So I booted the laptop. Each kata I tackle is one brick in my escape out of the gutter. I swear in Polish words like “kurwa” and “chuj” though I barely know what they mean — they taste like survival. Melbourne calls me still, Poznań tries to drown me. Code is my surfboard now.

### 🎯 **Sort and Star** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> You will be given a list of strings. You must sort it alphabetically (case-sensitive and based on ASCII values) and return the first value.  
> The returned value must be a string with `"***"` between each of its letters.  
> Do not remove or add elements from/to the array.

---

### 🎯 **Grasshopper – Messi Goals** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Use variables to find the sum of goals Messi scored in 3 competitions.  
> **Information:**  
> - La Liga = 43  
> - Champions League = 10  
> - Copa del Rey = 5  
> Create these three variables and store the values.  
> Then create a fourth variable `totalGoals` that stores their sum.

---

### 🎯 **Find Multiples of a Number** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Write a function that takes two integers `n` and `limit`, and returns a list of multiples of `n` up to (and possibly including) `limit`.  
> **Examples:**  
> `n = 2; limit = 6 → [2, 4, 6]`  
> `n = 2; limit = 5 → [2, 4]`

---

### 🎯 **Short Long Short** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Given two strings `a` and `b`, return a string in the form `short+long+short`, with the shorter string on the outside and the longer one in the middle.  
> **Examples:**  
> `("1", "22") → "1221"`  
> `("22", "1") → "1221"`

---

### 🎯 **My head is at the wrong end!** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> You’re at the zoo — all the meerkats look weird because someone switched their heads and tails around!  
> Given an array containing three values `(tail, body, head)`, re-arrange the array so that it becomes `(head, body, tail)`.  
> Apply the same logic to all test cases. Simples!

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
Sorting strings and injecting `"***"`, summing goals with simple variables, listing multiples up to a limit, weaving short-long-short strings, flipping arrays like I’ve flipped my life — the logic’s simple, the fight’s not.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
I’ll wander through Poznań’s Stary Rynek, maybe check out the old city walls for a break from the grey, or hit a cheap bar if the fridge’s bones are empty. Down one cold one, then head back to the laptop — because Melbourne’s sun still waits, and I’ve got to earn it.
