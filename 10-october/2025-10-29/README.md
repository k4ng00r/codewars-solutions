## 📓 Diary
Dragged myself through Poznań drizzle that smells like tram brakes and damp leaves. The sky wore the same colour as my hoodie: questionable grey. Melbourne’s on the other side of the planet doing its “maybe sun, maybe sulk” routine, but in my head it’s all gulls and sunscreen. I brewed instant coffee that tasted like regret and promised myself two things: fewer detours into nostalgia, more reps of JavaScript. That old story still buzzes in the background — rich kid, party king, one spiked beer, wake up in a cage, new life in Poland. But today the main character is smaller: a clean desk, a stubborn cursor, and the tiny wins that stack like bricks. If I keep stacking, one day it’s a runway to Sydney. For now, it’s Keystrokes > Chaos.

## 🧩 Codewars Katas (8 kyu)

---

### 🎯 **The 'if' function**
> **Description:**  
> Create a function called `_if` which takes 3 arguments: a value `bool` and 2 functions (which do not take any parameters): `func1` and `func2`.  
>  
> When `bool` is truthy, `func1` should be called, otherwise call the `func2`.  
>  
> **Example:**
> ```js
> _if(true, function(){ console.log("True") }, function(){ console.log("false") })
> // Logs 'True' to the console.
> ```

---

### 🎯 **Welcome to the City**
> **Description:**  
> Create a method that takes as input a name, city, and state to welcome a person. Note that `name` will be an array consisting of one or more values that should be joined together with one space between each, and the length of the name array in test cases will vary.  
>  
> **Example:**  
> `['John', 'Smith'], 'Phoenix', 'Arizona'`  
> This example will return the string `Hello, John Smith! Welcome to Phoenix, Arizona!`

---

### 🎯 **To square(root) or not to square(root)**
> **Description:**  
> Write a method, that will get an integer array as parameter and will process every number from this array.  
>  
> Return a new array with processing every number of the input-array like this:  
> If the number has an integer square root, take this, otherwise square the number.  
>  
> **Example**  
> `[4,3,9,7,2,1] -> [2,9,3,49,4,1]`  
> **Notes**  
> The input array will always contain only positive numbers, and will never be empty or null.

---

### 🎯 **Bin to Decimal**
> **Description:**  
> Complete the function which converts a binary number (given as a string) to a decimal number.

---

### 🎯 **Surface Area and Volume of a Box**
> **Description:**  
> Write a function that returns the total surface area and volume of a box.  
>  
> The given input will be three positive non-zero integers: `width`, `height`, and `depth`.  
> The output will be language dependant, so please check sample tests for the corresponding data type (list, tuple, struct, query, etcetera).

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
- Wiring control flow into higher-order functions: pass actions in, flip them on a boolean, no drama.  
- Clean string assembly: join arrays of name parts like a civilized human instead of manual spacing mishaps.  
- Transform-by-rule pipelines: integer square roots vs squaring everything else, aka “map with brains.”  
- Base conversion sanity: binary strings to decimals without tripping over leading zeros.  
- Box maths refresher: `2*(w*h + w*d + h*d)` for surface area, `w*h*d` for volume, and don’t mix units like a clown.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Refill the mug, queue a lo-fi playlist, and knock out a few more katas while Poznań argues with the clouds. If the fridge is somehow stocked, I’ll pretend the bubbles are from Bondi and keep typing till the cursor stops judging me.
