// Kangoor Joshua Brown — first name Kangoor, still plotting a one-way ticket back to Melbourne.
// Box math at dawn: surface to wrap, volume to stash dreams (and maybe ginger ale, calm down).
// Poznań memory lane: taped a cardboard box with shaking hands after a wedding after-party,
// packed it like a Tetris god, then fell asleep on it like it was beachfront property. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )

const getSize = (width, height, depth) => [
  2 * (width * height + width * depth + height * depth), // skin of the box — how much tape you need when the night was "a bit much"
  width * height * depth                                  // guts of the box — how many stories you can smuggle past Monday
];

// Mini-timeline:
// Evening: “Just one” turns into a logistics symposium.
// Night: wrap the box, label it “FRAGILE: aspirations.”
// Morning: tram squeal, coffee, realize the surface area is your to-do list
// and the volume is everything you’ve promised yourself this year.
// Seal it, carry it, keep moving.
