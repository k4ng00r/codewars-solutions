// multiplication table, ten lines of discipline I never had
// I line them up like empty bottles after a Thursday “just one beer” ritual
// 1..10 marching, times ‘number’, equals… consequences
// Poznań kitchen light flickers, kettle screams, I pretend it’s the crowd in Sydney chanting my name
// then reality slaps: it’s just me, caffeine, and a crusty calculator brain
// kurwa.
// each row is a memory: “1 * you = hope”, “2 * you = maybe”, “3 * you = don’t text your ex”
// by 10 I’m negotiating with destiny like a bouncer: “let me in, I’ve got a function”
// chuj.
// ASCII rain on the window: ||| || ||| |  and I still miss the ocean spray
// I won’t touch the logic. I just smear life between the lines like mustard on a hot bun
// if this prints clean with no trailing newline, I buy myself a victory sausage
// if not, roadside poetry and shame. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

// minimal, brutal, true. ten truths stacked like debts.
// running tests is church now; passing them is communion.
