  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Even or Odd Night //

  Even or odd, mate â€” story of my bloody life.  
  Some nights were even, steady, quiet â€” a smoke, a drink, a woman who didnâ€™t ask questions.  
  Other nights went sideways â€” odd as hell, cops, coke, and a sunrise I didnâ€™t deserve.  

  Now I check numbers instead of my pulse.  
  Positive, negative, float, who cares?  
  If thereâ€™s a fraction left, itâ€™s uneven â€” like me after three days without sleep.  
  Truth or false, sober or not â€”  
  itâ€™s all the same math when youâ€™re just trying to balance the mess.
