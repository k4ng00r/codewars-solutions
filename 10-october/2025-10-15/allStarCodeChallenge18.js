  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Letter Counter //

  Counting letters, huh? Used to count cigarette butts and coins from the pavement.  
  Now I count characters in strings â€” cleaner habit, same twitch in the fingers.  
  Every 'l', every 'o', feels like tracking old mistakes:  
  how many nights I drank too much, how many names I forgot.  

  They tell you codeâ€™s logical, but itâ€™s just memory, mate.  
  Every loop a relapse, every match a flashback.  
  Sometimes the countâ€™s zero, sometimes it hits you twice â€”  
  just like a bad weekend with good intentions.
