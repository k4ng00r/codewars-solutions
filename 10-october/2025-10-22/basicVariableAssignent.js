// Aussie chaos begins
var a = "code";
var b = "wa.rs";
var name = a + b;
// mate, someone had written '==' instead of '=', like they were trying to compare their life to mine

// anyway, now it works, name = "codewa.rs"
// pure poetry, unlike my rent contract in Poznań
// I fixed it and still feel empty inside, but at least JavaScript’s happy
