## 📓 Diary
Dragged myself through Poznań’s damp morning, trams squealing like they needed therapy more than I do. Somewhere twelve thousand kilometres away, Melbourne is pretending it’s already summer, sunscreen ad on loop, gulls casing your chips at St Kilda. Meanwhile I’m counting puddles on Jeżyce cobbles and trying not to turn them into metaphors.

Made a deal with myself: one cup of dodgy instant, five katas, and I get to daydream about Sydney’s surf for a full ten minutes. The old story still lurks: rich kid glow-up, one rave too far, wake up in a cage speaking accidental Polish. But tonight the hero is smaller and meaner: clean commit history, tidy functions, no excuses. I want that one-way ticket home so badly I can hear the boarding call. Until then, code, breathe, and keep the head down. Melbourne can wait. I’ll get there when the tests go green.

## 🧩 Codewars Katas (8 kyu)

### 🎯 Grasshopper - Personalized Message
> Create a function that gives a personalized greeting. This function takes two parameters: name and owner.  
>  
> Use conditionals to return the proper message:  
>  
> case return  
> name equals owner 'Hello boss'  
> otherwise 'Hello guest' <- block_of_text <- do_not_modify_kata_description_just_format_it_properly

### 🎯 Is n divisible by x and y?
> Create a function that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y. All inputs are positive, non-zero numbers.  
>  
> **Examples:**  
> n = 3, x = 1, y = 3 => true because 3 is divisible by 1 and 3  
>  
> n = 12, x = 2, y = 6 => true because 12 is divisible by 2 and 6  
>  
> n = 100, x = 5, y = 3 => false because 100 is not divisible by 3  
>  
> n = 12, x = 7, y = 5 => false because 12 is neither divisible by 7 nor 5 <- block_of_text <- do_not_modify_kata_description_just_format_it_properly

### 🎯 Remove exclamation marks
> Write function RemoveExclamationMarks which removes all exclamation marks from a given string. <- block_of_text <- do_not_modify_kata_description_just_format_it_properly

### 🎯 Transportation on vacation
> After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.  
>  
> You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.  
>  
> Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.  
>  
> Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d). <- block_of_text <- do_not_modify_kata_description_just_format_it_properly

### 🎯 Quarter of the year
> Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.  
>  
> For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.  
>  
> Constraint:  
>  
> 1 <= month <= 12 <- block_of_text <- do_not_modify_kata_description_just_format_it_properly

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**
- Tiny, tidy functions beat heroic spaghetti. Conditional branches should read like plain English.
- Divisibility checks are pure arithmetic zen: early returns keep it clean.
- String cleanup is therapy for noisy inputs; regular loops or replace do the job, no drama.
- Tiered discounts are just guardrails: 7+ first, else 3+, else base rate.
- Quarter mapping is integer math with manners: `(month + 2) // 3` and you’re done.

**What I’m going to do now:**
Refill the cup, refactor the messiest helper, then take a victory lap through a couple more 8-kyu for rhythm. If Poznań stays soggy, I’ll aim for a late walk under neon and pretend it’s Swanston Street after rain. One day it will be.
