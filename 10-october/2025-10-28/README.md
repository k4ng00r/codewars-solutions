## 📓 Diary
Dragged myself out into Poznań’s grey soup and it felt like coding inside a fridge. Melbourne’s on the other side of the planet flexing sunlight like a show-off, and I’m here, counting puddles and pretending they’re rock pools. Grabbed a budget coffee that tasted like it studied “espresso” by correspondence, muttered a quiet “kurwa” at the drizzle, then parked myself by the window and pushed through katas. I keep seeing Bondi in the reflection of the glass. That’s the trick, hey? You grind in the cold so one day you sweat on hot sand again. JS in, booze out. Mostly. If the fridge isn’t lying.

## 🧩 Codewars Katas (8 kyu)

---

### 🎯 **Hello, Name or World!**
> **Description:**  
> Define a method hello that returns "Hello, Name!" to a given name, or says Hello, World! if name is not given (or passed as an empty String).  
>   
> Assuming that name is a String and it checks for user typos to return a name with a first capital letter (Xxxx).  
>   
> **Examples:**  
> * With `name` = "john"  => return "Hello, John!"  
> * With `name` = "aliCE" => return "Hello, Alice!"  
> * With `name` not given  
>   or `name` = ""        => return "Hello, World!"

### 🎯 **Well of Ideas - Easy Version**
> **Description:**  
> For every good kata idea there seem to be quite a few bad ones!  
>   
> In this kata you need to check the provided array (x) for good ideas 'good' and bad ideas 'bad'. If there are one or two good ideas, return 'Publish!', if there are more than 2 return 'I smell a series!'. If there are no good ideas, as is often the case, return 'Fail!'.

### 🎯 **Determine offspring sex based on genes XX and XY chromosomes**
> **Description:**  
> The male gametes or sperm cells in humans and other mammals are heterogametic and contain one of two types of sex chromosomes. They are either X or Y. The female gametes or eggs however, contain only the X sex chromosome and are homogametic.  
>   
> The sperm cell determines the sex of an individual in this case. If a sperm cell containing an X chromosome fertilizes an egg, the resulting zygote will be XX or female. If the sperm cell contains a Y chromosome, then the resulting zygote will be XY or male.  
>   
> Determine if the sex of the offspring will be male or female based on the X or Y chromosome present in the male's sperm.  
>   
> If the sperm contains the X chromosome, return "Congratulations! You're going to have a daughter."; If the sperm contains the Y chromosome, return "Congratulations! You're going to have a son.";

### 🎯 **Convert to Binary**
> **Description:**  
> **Task Overview**  
> Given a non-negative integer b, write a function which returns an integer d such that the binary representation of b is the same as the decimal representation of d.  
>   
> **Examples:**  
> n = 1 should return 1  
> n = 5 should return 101  
> n = 11 should return 1011

---

### 🎯 **No zeros for heroes**
> **Description:**  
> Numbers ending with zeros are boring.  
>   
> They might be fun in your world, but not here.  
>   
> Get rid of them. Only the ending ones.  
>   
> 1450   -> 145  
> 960000 -> 96  
> 1050   -> 105  
> -1050  -> -105  
> 0      -> 0  
> **Note:** Zero should be left as it is.

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:** tidied inputs into friendly outputs, counted “good” vs “bad” ideas without overthinking, poked binary until it lined up, and trimmed trailing zero ballast like a cheap haircut. Also refreshed the high-school bio trivia: it’s the sperm flipping the XX/XY coin, not the egg. Cheers, science.

**What I’m going to do now:** quick walk through the Poznań gloom to keep the head clear, maybe swing past Blask or Miel for a real coffee, then back to the keyboard. If the fridge whispers sweet nothings, I’ll pretend I don’t hear it. Spring sun is warming chairs in Melbourne; I’ll earn my seat at St Kilda later.
