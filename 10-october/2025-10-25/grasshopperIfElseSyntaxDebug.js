// last night, Friday Poznań:
// Piwna Stopa — "just one" turned into a tasting flight that tasted like regret,
// then Schron bunker where the bassline attempted CPR on my soul.
// somewhere between the smoke machine and a bathroom queue I "lost" my phone,
// then found it chilling in a girl's pocket like it paid rent. chuj.
// outside, a kid tried a pickpocket tutorial on me; I gave him a brofist and a candy bar,
// because karma is a boomerang and I’m already the target. kurwa.
// 03:17 a.m. Żabka hot dog, cashier with the thousand-yard stare, mustard acting like therapy.
// 09:02 a.m. Blask coffee, heart rate returns from dial-up to broadband.
// moral: health can hit 0, but don’t let it go negative — that’s where the ghosts dance. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
// ASCII heart monitor:  __/‾‾‾\___/‾\____/‾‾‾\____   beep
// hangover algebra complete. return to code, return to oxygen.
