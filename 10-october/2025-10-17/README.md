## 📓 Diary
Woke up with a familiar sting — not the booze, not the pills, but the loss. Australia’s bright lights still haunt the back of my skull. Kangoor Joshua Brown, once luxe, now digging through backstreets of Poznań for purpose. The bloke who took me in handed me coffee and closed his door. He didn’t ask questions. He just said: *“Don’t waste today.”* I gripped the laptop like a lifeline and dived into code. Each kata a step away from the drunk Friday nights, each line of JS a shaky promise I might get out of this slump.

### 🎯 **Find the first non-consecutive number** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not exactly 1 larger than the previous element.  
> If all elements are consecutive, return `null`.

*(…you can append more kata entries as needed…)*

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
How to detect breaks in sequences, handle edge conditions in arrays, and refocus when the world around you still spins out of control.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Either raid the fridge (pretty sure it’s empty) or hammer through more kata until the night doesn’t scare me so much — code, drink, code, whichever comes first.
