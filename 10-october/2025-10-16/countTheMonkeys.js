  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Jungle Mathematics //

  Monkeys, mate. Always monkeys.  
  Back in PoznaÅ„, we didnâ€™t have forests â€” just concrete, smog, and people pretending not to see you.  
  But I get it, the kidâ€™s gotta learn to count, same way I had to learn to crawl out of the gutter.  
  So here we are, counting from 1 to n, pretending it means something.  

  I didnâ€™t start coding for fun â€” fun was gone years ago, somewhere between the drugs and the debt.  
  My mate told me thereâ€™s money in it, I didnâ€™t even check justjoinit,  
  just nodded and lit another smoke.  
  Now I write functions about monkeys while dreaming of Melbourne â€”  
  that sweet chaos, the booze, the warmth.  
  Every number I count is one step closer to home, one line of code away from freedom.

const monkeyCount = (n) =>
  // okay so first... ehhh, yeah, Array(n) â€”  
  // creates a bunch of empty slots, like my brain on Monday morning.
  Array(n)
    // then fill(1) â€” donâ€™t ask why one, it just keeps JS from losing its shit.
    .fill(1)
    // map... yeah, map, I know map... it's the one that loops but fancier.
    // i + 1 because kidâ€™s gotta start from one, not zero â€”  
    // zeroâ€™s for accountants and people who never lived under a bridge.
    .map((_, i) => i + 1);
