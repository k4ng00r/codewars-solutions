/*
  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Space Greeting //

  "Hello, Mr. Spock." â€” sounds easy enough, mate,  
  but Iâ€™ve botched simpler things after two bottles of Å»oÅ‚Ä…dkowa.  
  These days I fix greetings for starships instead of burning bridges in PoznaÅ„.  
  Never thought Iâ€™d end up coding â€” I just needed cash and less frostbite.  

  My mate told me thereâ€™s money in JavaScript.  
  I didnâ€™t check justjoinit, didnâ€™t check shit â€”  
  I just believed, same way I believed that beer counted as breakfast.  
  Now I sit here writing polite little hellos to imaginary captains,  
  dreaming of Melbourne, neon nights, and the hum of a city that never judged me.  

  Didnâ€™t bother with arrow functions today â€”  
  feels like too much effort for a bloke who still forgets his own name sometimes.  
  Besides, function declarations are like me: old, stubborn, but still working.

function sayHello(name) {
  // Kangarooâ€™s interstellar manners â€” greet the captain, hide the hangover.
  // String interpolation does the talking so I donâ€™t have to.
  // Keep it simple, mate â€” no need for fancy syntax when a smile will do.
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
