  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Uppercase Nostalgia //

  All caps, huh?  
  Yeah mate, I used to yell everything too â€” mostly at bartenders and exes.  
  Now I yell at the compiler. Cleaner addiction, same attitude.  
  This kind of code takes me back â€” proper 2009 vintage JavaScript,  
  when men were drunk, browsers were stupid, and life felt infinite.  

  I was born in 2007 â€” just a joey back then.  
  Wild kangaroos donâ€™t live long, seven, maybe eight years if the outbackâ€™s kind.  
  But Iâ€™m still here, tapping keys in digital captivity,  
  like those zoo â€˜roos that outlive their instincts by a decade or two.  
  Guess Iâ€™m one of them now â€” old code, old soul, still running.  

  This snippet reminds me of my granddad, Joshua Brown â€”  
  bloke used to fix radios with bare wires and pure spite.  
  Heâ€™d laugh at this JavaScript nonsense,  
  but heâ€™d get it â€” uppercase means youâ€™re shouting at the void,  
  hoping something finally listens back.
