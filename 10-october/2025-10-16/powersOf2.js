  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Power Trip //

  Powers of two, eh? Yeah, sounds simple when you’re sober.  
  But I’ve done harder math trying to figure out how many beers I could buy  
  with the change from a bottle return behind Żabka.  
  Math was never my thing — too many numbers, not enough nicotine.  

  My mate told me there’s good cash in coding,  
  said “you just use math sometimes,” and I believed him.  
  Didn’t check justjoinit, didn’t even Google “what the hell is an exponent.”  
  Just went all in — no plan, no backup, same as Melbourne in ‘15.  

  Now I’m sitting here, hungover, making powers of two for some digital gods.  
  2⁰, 2¹, 2² — every line a bit of order in the chaos.  
  And yeah, maybe I don’t get all the math,  
  but I get the grind — and that’s close enough, mate.

    // 2 ** i — clean, sharp, mathematical, like vodka on an empty stomach.
