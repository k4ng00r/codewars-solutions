## 📓 Diary
G’day from the gloom-sodden streets of Poznań, where the drizzle fills the day like regret fills my head. In Melbourne, earlier this year, the sun kissed my skin and the waves whispered my name. Now I’m Kangoor Joshua Brown—once cruising Sydney’s beaches, now tripping over puddles in Poland.  
The bloke letting me crash tossed me a blanket and said, *“Mate, your code’s your ticket back.”* So I booted up the laptop as rain tapped on the window. Each keystroke tried to rewrite the past, to salvage the beach, the opera house, the bikinis. A keyboard, a coffee, and me against this grey sky.

### 🎯 **I love you, a little , a lot, passionately ... not at all** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:  
> *“I love you”*  
> *“a little”*  
> *“a lot”*  
> *“passionately”*  
> *“madly”*  
> *“not at all”*  
>  
> If there are more than 6 petals, you start over with “I love you” for 7 petals, “a little” for 8 petals and so on.  
> When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.  
>  
> Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say at the last petal for a flower of a given number of petals.  
> The number of petals is always greater than 0.

### 🎯 **Count Odd Numbers below n** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Given a number `n`, return the number of positive odd numbers below `n`.  
> **Examples:**  
> `7 -> 3` because odd numbers below 7 are `[1, 3, 5]`  
> `15 -> 7` because odd numbers below 15 are `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]`  
> Expect large inputs!

### 🎯 **Difference of Volumes of Cuboids** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> In this simple exercise, create a program that takes two lists of integers, `a` and `b`.  
> Each list consists of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids `a` and `b`.  
> Find the difference of the cuboids’ volumes regardless of which is bigger.  
> **Example:**  
> `([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]) → 8` because 12 and 20 give a difference of 8.  
>  
> Try writing it in one line of code.

### 🎯 **Welcome!** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Your start-up’s BA has told marketing that your website has a large audience in Scandinavia and surrounding countries.  
> Marketing thinks it would be great to welcome visitors to the site in their own language. Luckily you already use an API that detects the user’s location, so this is an easy win.  
>  
> **The Task:**  
> Think of a way to store the languages as a database.  
> Write a `welcome` function that takes a parameter `language` (String) and returns a greeting — if it exists in your database.  
> It should default to English if the language is not in the database or if input is invalid.  
>  
> **The Database:**  
> `[ ("english", "Welcome"), ("czech", "Vitejte"), ("danish", "Velkomst"), ("dutch", "Welkom"), ("estonian", "Tere tulemast"), ("finnish", "Tervetuloa"), ("flemish", "Welgekomen"), ("french", "Bienvenue"), ("german", "Willkommen"), ("irish", "Failte"), ("italian", "Benvenuto"), ("latvian", "Gaidits"), ("lithuanian", "Laukiamas"), ("polish", "Witamy"), ("spanish", "Bienvenido"), ("swedish", "Valkommen"), ("welsh", "Croeso") ]`  
>  
> **Possible invalid inputs:**  
> `IP_ADDRESS_INVALID` – not a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address  
> `IP_ADDRESS_NOT_FOUND` – IP address not in the database  
> `IP_ADDRESS_REQUIRED` – no IP address supplied

### 🎯 **Drink about** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Kids drink toddy.  
> Teens drink coke.  
> Young adults drink beer.  
> Adults drink whisky.  
>  
> **Rules:**  
> - Children under 14 → `"drink toddy"`  
> - Teens under 18 → `"drink coke"`  
> - Young under 21 → `"drink beer"`  
> - Adults 21 or older → `"drink whisky"`  
>  
> **Examples:**  
> `13 → "drink toddy"`  
> `17 → "drink coke"`  
> `18 → "drink beer"`  
> `20 → "drink beer"`  
> `30 → "drink whisky"`

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
Cracked petal logic, counted odds under ceilings, found cuboid volume differences, built greeting databases, and mapped age-to-drink rules — strange little islands of logic in a storm of life.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
I’ll likely stagger over to Poznań’s Old Market Square, breathe in the chill, maybe find a hidden pub (if it’s open), or I’ll lock myself behind the laptop until the world dims. Then maybe a cold one, maybe more code — because the sun in Melbourne still calls.
