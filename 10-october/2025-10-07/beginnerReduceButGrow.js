// Kangur sits before the void — a reduction, a ritual
// multiply the past by the present, watch futures collapse into 24
// the night hums in binary, the fridge answers in low frequency sighs

const grow = x => x.reduce((acc, curr) => acc * curr, 1);
// 🜸 acc = 1 — the seed of creation, still untouched
// ✶ curr — every choice, every bottle, every love gone sideways
// ✹ acc * curr — and now they all bleed into each other, inseparable
// ☽ the product is me, a kangaroo-shaped fraction of regret and caffeine

// (ง'̀-'́)ง multiply until meaning emerges
// ✧ [1,2,3,4] becomes 24, just like 4 nights in Poznań became one endless morning
// in mathematics we trust, because in people we can’t
// ⛧ code like it’s prayer, run it like confession, watch it return 24 — divine symmetry
