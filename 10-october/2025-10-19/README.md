## 📓 Diary
I woke up to the city's grey stillness, the kind that squeezes you by the throat before morning coffee even hits. Kangoor Joshua Brown once soared above Sydney’s beaches; now I’m Kangur, inching through Poznań alleys, trying to dig myself out of yesterday’s wreckage. The bloke who gave me a roof handed me a half-cracked mug and said, *“Kick the code or the code kicks back.”* So I opened the laptop, the hum was my new soundtrack. I typed in silence, chasing the echo of the life I lost, hoping these functions and logic bricks might rebuild something—maybe the beach, maybe the glory, maybe just dignity.

## 🧩 Codewars Katas

### 🎯 **Student’s Final Grade** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Create `finalGrade(exam, projects)` that returns:  
> - `100` if `exam > 90` or `projects > 10`  
> - `90` if `exam > 75` and `projects ≥ 5`  
> - `75` if `exam > 50` and `projects ≥ 2`  
> - otherwise `0`

---

### 🎯 **Do I get a bonus?** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Given `salary` (int) and `bonus` (boolean):  
> - if `bonus = true`, return `salary × 10` prefixed with a currency symbol (`£`, `$`, or `¥`).  
> - if `bonus = false`, return the salary prefixed normally.

---

### 🎯 **Sum The Strings** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Given two integers as strings (possibly empty), return their sum as a string.  
> **Examples:**  
> `"4", "5" → "9"`  
> `"-5", "3" → "-2"`

---

### 🎯 **Expressions Matter** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Given three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (each 1–10),  
> return the maximum value obtainable by inserting `+`, `*`, and parentheses in every possible combination without reordering operands.

---

### 🎯 **Reverse List Order** — *8 kyu*
> **Description:**  
> Given a list, return a new list with the reverse order.  
> **Example:**  
> `[1, 2, 3, 4] → [4, 3, 2, 1]`

## 🧭 Summary
**What I’ve learned:**  
How to calculate final grades with branching logic, handle salary-bonus formatting, sum numeric strings, evaluate all arithmetic combinations, and reverse lists efficiently — the toolbox keeps growing.

**What I’m going to do now:**  
Likely raid the fridge (but spoiler: it’s still empty) or dive deeper into code until my head stops spinning and the city noise fades into background hum. Maybe a drink later, maybe a few more katas. Either way: I’m moving.
