  // 🦘 Kangaroo’s Fatcat Math //

  Bonus time, eh? bloody rich bastards.  
  I used to think *I* was rich — Melbourne penthouse, pool full of girls and gin,  
  and a dog that cost more than my current life savings.  
  Then came the crash, the pills, the dealers, and that one flight I never meant to board.  

  Now I’m in Poznań, counting złotówki and writing code like it’s redemption.  
  “Multiply by 10 if bonus,” they say.  
  Mate, if life had that kind of logic, I’d still be in Bondi drinking breakfast from the bottle.  
  But nah — no ternary operator for life, only hangovers and syntax errors.  

  Anyway, here’s your bloody pound sign. I don’t even have a bank account.
