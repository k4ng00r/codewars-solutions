// Kangoor Joshua Brown — yes, Kangoor is the first name. Accountant hat on, beach hat waiting.
// Rule of the jungle (and Żabka checkout): every third mango is on the house.
// Evening: I planned to buy 2. Night: I bought 9. Morning: the receipt says math happened.
// Timeline: count sets of three → one free each set → wallet breathes again. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )

const mango = (quantity, price) => (quantity - Math.floor(quantity / 3)) * price;

// Poznań flashback:
// Cashier scans 🥭🥭🆓 in rhythms like club lights at Schron.
// I whisper “buy two, get one free” like a mantra, pretending this is budgeting.
// Melbourne memory drifts in: sun, market stalls, sticky fingers, zero regrets.
// Moral: when life groups things in threes, let it. Your bank balance will thank you.
