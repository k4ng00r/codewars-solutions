  // ðŸ¦˜ Kangarooâ€™s Report Card //

  End of the school year, mate.  
  Everyoneâ€™s lining up with their sad little averages,  
  begging me to crunch the numbers.  
  "Oi Kangaroo, can ya do my math?" â€” yeah right,  
  as if Iâ€™m not already three beers deep and halfway to Darwin.  

  But hey, calculating grades is easier than remembering last night.  
  Add 'em up, divide by how many youâ€™ve got, round down,  
  and pretend you tried your best.  
  Just like life, really â€” keep your expectations low and youâ€™ll pass.
